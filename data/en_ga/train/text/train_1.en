Your symptoms of illness
If you share the information with us, it will be uploaded to the hse and shared anonymously with the central statistics office (cso).
This information helps us to understand more about the spread of the virus.
Whether or not you want to share this data with us is always your choice.
You can change the information you need to share with us at any time.
Read more about the data collected and processed.
Ip address
Your ip address is a unique collection of numbers that identifies your phone or computer when you use the internet.
Ip addresses are used so that you can send and receive information online.
Your ip address is automatically shared each time you use an app or visit a website.
We do not need your ip address.
We delete it from the server as soon as we receive the data you share with us from the app.
Unknown data
Anonymous data we collect includes:
Details of how you use the app
Data we use for contact tracking
Details on how you use the app
We collect data about how you use the app.
This is called 'app metric data'.
We collect this data in order to improve the app and to understand:
How the app is used
Its effect on slowing the spread of the virus
Metric data of this app does not reveal your name.
But it is your choice whether or not you want to share this data.
Contact tracking details
To enable contact tracking, the covid tracker uses a technology developed by apple and google called disclosure notification.
The disclosure notification enables your phone to create and share random ids.
These random ids are shared when you are in close contact with other users of the app.
You can read more about the disclosure notification system on the apple or google website.
The app uses this anonymous data to notify you of:
The time you spent with another unknown user of the app
The strength of the bluetooth signal of the other user of the other app and how to work out how close you were to them
That data stays on your phone.
No one can access them unless you choose to share them.
You will be asked if you wish to share the data with the hse if you test positive for covid-19.
Random ids shared with the hse are deleted every 14 days.
You can delete the app as well as the data collected on it whenever you want.
We have worked with apple and google to ensure that contact tracking functionality works effectively for as many phones as possible.
Third party bodies
For the functionality of the app, we use services from a number of companies.
These third-party companies process some data from the app, including your anonymous information.
Safe, secure and compliant
We created the app based on eu guidelines, eu recommendations on privacy, hse standards and data protection law.
This means that the app:
Safe and secure to use
Law-abiding
Meets the standards expected to keep data secure and confidential
Contact tracking on the entire app is decentralized.
The random ids on your phone are matched.
This means that no one can track your location, your movements or the people you have contacted.
Read more about compliance and security.
Deleting your data
You can choose to delete the app and delete your data at any time.
To do this:
Go to 'settings' in the app.
Select 'leave'.
Click on 'i want to leave'.
This will delete the app and your data.
When the government announces the outbreak is over, the app will no longer work.
You will be prompted to delete the app and all data.
It will no longer be available on the app stores either.

What you should do
Why you should track your signs
When you keep a record of your symptoms every day:
You will be able to remember when you became ill
It will be useful if you have to talk to your gp
It will help you get reliable advice quickly
It will help us map the virus and predict how it will spread.

Any health information you share will be anonymous.
You do not need to track your signals for other app functions to work.
How covid check-in works
Press the 'check-in covid' button at the bottom of the app.
You will be given 2 options:
'i'm fine, i have no sign '.
'i don't feel well today '.
If you have no symptoms
When you select 'i'm fine, i have no sign', your check-in will end
If you have symptoms

The technology used by the covid tracker app
Privacy and how we use your data
If you have been in close contact with another app user who tested positive for covid-19 you will receive an alert on your mobile phone.
What is the meaning of an immediate contact alert?
An immediate contact alert means that you have been within 2 meters of a person with the virus for a relatively long time (more than 15 minutes) and that you could get the virus.
You will never know who is infected or where the first contact occurred.
You will need to act as you could spread the virus to others.
What you should do
The alert will advise you to:
Restrict your movements if you have no symptoms.
Self-isolation if you have symptoms.
Get a covid-19 test.
It is important to follow this advice to protect yourself and others.
Arrange a test appointment
You will be asked if you want to share your phone number when you first launch the app on your mobile phone and when you receive an alert.
If you give us your phone number, the contact tracking team will be able to call you.
They will be able to arrange a free covid-19 test for you.
If you decide not to give us your phone number on the app, call the covid helpline.
They will take your data so that someone can call you and arrange a test for you.
You may receive a call from the contact tracking team even if you do not provide your phone number.
Sometimes this happens if someone else who tested positive for covid-19 gives your staff phone number because you are a close contact.
How to view the immediate contact alert
You will see an instant contact alert in 2 places on your mobile phone.
You will see it:
As a screen notification for a mobile phone
When you open the covid tracker app
Notice on the home screen
This is how you will see the alert notification on the home screen of your mobile phone.
The message in the notification will be: 'Close contact alert: Please see the covid tracker app now'.
Maybe it will go away after a while.
Alert within the covid administrator app
This is how you will see the alert notification when you open the covid tracker app.
This alert will be in a red box: 'Close contact alert: The app detects that you were in close contact with someone who tested positive for covid-19'.
This alert will remain on your phone for 14 days.
It will be on the screen for this period whenever you open the app.
The alert can be cleared in the app's contact tracking settings.
Potential disclosure alert
You will only see this alert if you are using an older version of the mobile phone operating system.
You should update your software and get the latest version of ios or android for free.
A potential exposure alert is not the same as an immediate contact alert.
You don ’ t have to do anything.
Potential exposure means that you may have been close to someone who tested positive for covid-19 but were not close enough for a long time to be a close contact.
Therefore there is little risk of you getting the virus.
For example, it could be someone who passed by on the street or queued them for less than 15 minutes.
If you work in a healthcare setting or school
There is little risk of you getting the virus if the people around you are wearing personal protective equipment, such as in a hospital or school.
However, you may receive an immediate contact alert anyway.
Healthcare workers
Read advice for healthcare workers who use the app and wear personal protective equipment.
Schools
If a covid-19 case has been confirmed in your school, you will be contacted by your local public health team.
They will tell you if you need to do anything.
If you receive an immediate contact alert and you receive a call from a contact tracker, tell them where you work.
If there has been a case recently, tell them.
They will be able to tell you what you should do.

Prioritize public health advice
The covid tracking app is designed to make the best use of the best available health advice and technology.
But it ’ s not perfect.
It is just one of our ways to delay the spread of covid-19, and current public health guidelines should not be ignored.
It is still important to:
Follow social separation advice - keep 2 meters (6.5 feet) away from others
Wash your hands often and adequately
Cover your mouth with a handkerchief or sleeve when you cough or sneeze
Wear a face cover
Get tested if you have symptoms or have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for covid-19
If you are unable to use the app
The app is just one aspect of our contact tracking operation.

Everyone is included in that process, whether you use the app or not.
We hope that more people will have access to the updated versions of the app in the future.
We continue to look at solutions to include everyone over the age of 16.
Keep your child at home
If your child has had close contact with someone with covid-19, if your child lives with someone with covid-19 symptoms or has been abroad, do not allow them to go to school or attend childcare
They will have to restrict their movements for 14 days even if they have no signs of illness.
They may stop restricting their movements when both of the following conditions apply:
When they tested negative (covid-19 was not detected) 10 days after contact with the person who tested positive.
When they do not have covid-19 symptoms.
If your child is in close contact with covid-19
If your child has covid-19 symptoms and is in close contact with someone who has tested positive, he / she should:
Stay away from others immediately
Call your gp
Follow the advice for children with covid-19 symptoms.
If your child is a close contact but does not have covid-19 symptoms:
Restrict your movements for 14 days - don't go to school either
Get a covid-19 test - this will be arranged by a contact administrator when he / she calls you
The child can stop restricting their movements if:
If they test negative (covid-19 was not detected) 10 days after contact with the person who tested positive
If they do not have covid-19 symptoms
People living with the child, including siblings, do not need to restrict their movements.
If your child lives with someone suspected of having covid-19
Your child will need to restrict their movements.
If your child has symptoms, keep them away from others and call your doctor.
If your child was abroad
Your child will have to restrict their movements for 14 days if they have returned from a foreign country.
He will have to stay home and not attend school, even if he does not feel ill.
They only need to go to the gp if they have symptoms of illness.
A swab is taken from your nose during the covid-19 antigen test. The sample does not need to be taken to the laboratory.
The test results are faster than the covid-19 pcr test, but it is limited.
Antigen testing is also known as rapid antigen diagnostic testing (radt).
Where the covid-19 antigen tests are used
Antigen tests are provided for:
Some hospital patients with covid-19 symptoms, including those attending the emergency department (ed)
People in locations where there is an outbreak of covid-19
What happens during the test
The tester will give you a mask to explain what will happen and ask you some questions.
You will be asked to clean your hands properly with a hand disinfectant.
The tester will take some personal data from you, including your telephone number.
Make sure they have the correct number.
The tester will use a swab to take a sample from your nose.
This may be uncomfortable, but it will not be painful.
The tester will test the sample on-site.
If you get a positive result on your antigen test
Within 1 hour of your trial, you will be notified if a positive impact (covid-19 is found) on your test.
This means that the virus was detected in your sample.
You will have to stay on your own because there is a real risk that you will pass on the virus to others.
What you need to do if you have a positive covid-19 test result
If you get a negative or invalid result on your antigen test
A negative result indicates that the virus was not detected in your sample.
Sometimes a positive or negative result is not detected on the antigen test.
This is called an 'invalid result'.
If the first sample is negative or invalid, we will send the second sample to a laboratory for covid-19 pcr testing.
If the second test is positive
You will receive a text message with the result of the covid-19 pcr test.
If the result is positive, you will receive a phone call from a contact tracker.
Contact tracing
How to self-isolate (stay in your room)
There is a limit to what the antigen test for covid-19 can do
No complete test is accurate.
There is a limit to what any test can do,
Antigen testing is less accurate than pcr testing for covid-19.
The test will detect the virus in most people with symptoms of illness
But in some cases, the test will not detect the virus.
Tell the healthcare worker immediately if you have covid-19 symptoms.
The hse only accepts polymerase chain reaction (pcr) tests to diagnose covid-19.
This is the most reliable way to test.
Private companies can offer other types of tests.
We do not recommend any particular test provider.
If you have covid-19 symptoms, you should isolate yourself immediately.
Call your doctor, and they will arrange a free hse test for you.
Read about how to test for covid-19.
Read about what to do if you are a close contact
Polymerase chain reaction test
This is the most reliable covid-19 test available because it looks at the genetic material of the virus.
The test is done in a laboratory and can be relied upon if you need to know if you have covid-19.
If you receive an isp test from a private company and test positive for covid-19, the laboratory must report this to the health service executive.
This information is required so that the contact tracking team can access your immediate contacts.
Read more about contact tracking.
Antigen testing
Antigen testing is faster than isp testing but not as reliable.
This type of test does not require a laboratory.
The hse does not currently accept antigen testing.
If your antigen test is positive
If you receive an antigen test from a private company and test positive for covid-19, the laboratory will not report this to the hse.
This means that your immediate contacts will not be notified and may spread covid-19 to others.
If you have tested positive, you should self-isolate and call your gp.
He / she will arrange for you a free isp test.
Find a doctor in your area.
You will need to show proof of the covid-19 test result to the doctor.
You will need one of the following:
Text message
Email
Printed report
If you have symptoms of illness but your test for covid-19 was negative
If you have covid-19 symptoms, you should self-isolate even if your antigen test result is negative.
Call your doctor, and they will arrange a free isp test for you.
Mas gartheagmhálaí animal
If you are a close contact, you should continue to restrict your movements even if your test was negative.
Continue to restrict your movements for 14 days from the last time you were in contact with the person who tested positive for the covid-19 test.
Antibody tests
Antibody tests check for antibodies if a person has had the virus in the past.
A blood sample is required to perform this test.
The hse does not currently offer these tests.
If you came to ireland from brazil or south africa:
You should isolate yourself (stay in your room) for 14 days from the date you arrived in ireland
Call your gp to arrange a covid-19 test - the test should be done five days after you arrive in ireland or as soon as you can after that five days.
If you do not have a gp, any doctor, or an out-of-hours doctor service, we can arrange a free covid-19 test for you.
This advice is being given because there are new strains of covid-19 in these countries.
These new strains of covid-19 are spreading faster than the other strains and are therefore more dangerous.
Positive test result
The following information is for people who have tested positive for covid-19:
People who recently arrived from south africa and brazil or
People living or working with a person who has come from south africa or brazil in the last 14 days
What you should do
Stay alone (stay in your room) for 14 days.
What your close contacts should do

By law, you must wear a face mask:
On public transport
In shops, shopping malls and a number of other indoor locations
In banks, post offices and credit unions
Face cover should also be worn:
When it is not possible to stay away 2 meters from others
In hospitals, doctor's dispensary, nursing homes and at the dentist and other health centres
When people are visiting people who are at greater risk from covid-19 - e.g. people over the age of 70 or people who are vulnerable to health
In crowded workplaces, places of worship and busy outdoor places where many people gather
There are people who should not / cannot wear face cover.
Read about those who should not wear one.
When a disposable mask should be worn
A single-use mask is also called a surgical mask.
This is the usual type of face mask that is typically sold in pharmacies and other stores.
Wear a single-use mask instead of a face mask if you are at increased risk of contracting a serious illness caused by covid-19.
It is not the same as a face cover and gives you better protection.
You should wear a disposable mask at home
If you are self-isolated
If you tested positive for covid-19 - you must stay in your room
If you live with someone with covid-19
Read about face masks, masks and cellulite here
Why a face cover should be worn
Covid-19 is mainly spread by direct contact and droplets coming from your nose and mouth.
For example, when you are coughing, sneezing or talking loudly.
Wearing a facial cover reduces the spread of these droplets.
It also helps prevent people who do not know they have the virus from spreading it.
If you wear a face mask, you should do the other important things to prevent the spread of the virus.
These include:
Social separation
Covering your mouth and nose with a handkerchief or sleeve while coughing and sneezing
Wash your hands properly, and often
Not to touch your eyes, nose or mouth unless your hands are clean
Read the advice on how to protect yourself and others.
When a face cover should be worn.
By law, you must wear face cover on public transport, and:
Shops and pharmacies and i
Shopping centres
Libraries
Cinemas
Theaters
Concert halls
Bingo halls
Museums
Nail salon
Hair salon and barbers
Tattoo and piercing shops
Travel agents and tour operators
Laundry and dry cleaners
Bookmakers
When you can remove the face cover
You can remove the face cover to:
Talk to someone who has communication difficulties
Providing emergency assistance or care to a vulnerable person
Taking medication
You may be asked to remove your face cover to confirm your age or identity.
You can also remove your face cover when you are:
Eating and drinking in a restaurant or café - throw one when you're not at your table
When you are receiving medical or dental treatment
You do not need to wear a face cover if you have an illness or weakness that would make it difficult for you to wear a face cover.
People who should not wear a face cover
Face masks are not recommended for the following:
Someone who has trouble breathing
Unconscious person or speech
A person who is unable to remove it without help
A person with special needs or hearing difficulties or who is deaf
A person who communicates with a person with learning difficulties or who is hard of hearing or deaf
In cases like this, the person will get some protection from the cellar if they are able to wear it.
But it is only in these cases that cells should be consumed.
It is best to wear a face cover made of cloth to protect yourself from covid-19.
Letters of exemption
Some workplaces or schools may request a medical certificate.
But generally, you do not need to ask for a letter from a gp about your reason for not wearing a face cover.
Children and face covers
Children under the age of 13 are not advised to wear face masks, but some children may choose to wear one.
There is a good chance that young children will not follow the advice on how to wear face masks properly.
But children under 13 should wear face cover if their doctor or healthcare worker recommends they do so.
For example, some children may be encouraged to do this while attending a hospital clinic for example.
Children who may be under 13 in their first year of secondary school should wear face cover while attending school.
This is because they are at the same stage of development as their peers and can follow the advice on using face masks properly.
There is no evidence that a coronavirus can be sexually transmitted.
However, it can be spread through close contact with someone who has the virus.
Reducing your risk of contracting the coronary virus
You may not know if someone has a coronavirus.
There is some risk of getting the virus if you are sexually active with another person.
You can reduce this risk by:
Have sexual intercourse with a partner you live with and who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus
Don't kiss anyone outside your family and anyone with symptoms - it's easy to spread the crown virus by kissing
Wash your hands properly before and after sex
If you decide to have sex with someone who does not live with you, limit it to a few partners as possible, one regular partner if possible.
Read more about sex and the crown virus on sexual wellbeing. ie
Read more about how the coronavirus is spread.
Restriction on sexually transmitted infection (sti) services
Many sti services are currently restricted due to the coronavirus.
Telephone support is available in some services.
Further information is available on the hiv ireland website.
Contraception
Pharmacies are open as usual and can give you your usual contraceptive prescription.
If your hormonal contraceptive prescription is to be renewed, your pharmacist may be able to provide you with extra supplies if it is safe and appropriate to do so.
Emergency contraception
You can get emergency (hormonal) contraception without a prescription from your local pharmacy.
Call your pharmacist to see if they can do the consultation over the phone.
This reduces the amount of time you have to spend in the pharmacy.
Emergency hormonal contraception can be taken up to 5 days after unprotected sex.
The sooner you take it, the more effective it becomes.

The test for covid-19 may be done on your child
There are many possible causes for your child to become ill suddenly.
Covid-19 does not usually cause serious illness in children, but it sometimes does.
That's why your doctor would have to rule out covid-19.
Your gp will ask your child to test for covid-19 if they have been in contact with someone who has had a negative result.
Your child may also need to be tested for covid-19 in the following situations:
Unless your gp is unsure of your child 's illness
Someone else in the house is sick but does not know why
What will happen next?
Your gp will assess your child and recommend treatment for their symptoms of illness.
You will be asked to keep an eye on your child in case it gets worse.
Your child will need to stay away from others until they know for sure that they do not have covid-19 by:
Different diagnosis or
Negative test result
Staying away from others is like keeping your child at home and separated from others.
Do not allow any visitors.
Read advice on how to care for a child who has to self-isolate.
Make sure your child continues to wash their hands properly and regularly and follow the cough and sneezing advice; wash their hands properly and regularly and follow hygiene advice around coughing and sneezing.
If your child is not tested and your doctor does not know what their illness is, they will be treated as if they had covid-19.
Everyone who has been in contact with your child should be aware of the symptoms of covid-19 in case the symptoms occur.
Pediatric multiple inflammatory syndrome (pims)
A small number of children with coronavirus had to undergo hospital treatment for an inflammatory syndrome known as pediatric multiple systemic inflammatory syndrome (pims).
Pims is a life-threatening disorder.
It is caused by an abnormal response of the body's immune system to infection.
It is similar to kawasaki disease or toxic disturbance syndrome and is uncommon.
We do not know if these children received pims because they had covid-19.
It is too early to see if there is any connection.
Children who require hospital treatment for pims are now being tested for the virus.
This is a precaution.
It is important that your children are involved in your plans to deal with the coronavirus.
Think about how they feel.
Give children and young people time and space to talk about the outbreak.
Share the facts with them in a way that suits their age and attitude, and do not be afraid.
Talk to your children about covid-19 (coronavirus).
Restrict what news and social media they see.
This is especially important for older children as they spend more time online.
It could be a cause for concern for them.
If they are online, tell them where to find accurate information.

Signs of illness - call your gp
It is important to remember that 9 out of 10 people who have blood in their bowel movements (shit) will not have cancer.
A small growth called polyps or other illnesses such as ficus (hemorrhoids) can cause blood in your shit.
It is very important to be aware of the symptoms of bowel cancer.
Signs include:
The constant change in normal bowel movements.
Going more often, with diarrhoea with pain in the stomach sometimes
Blood in your shit, especially if it is mixed through the shit.
This makes it unlikely that hemorrhoids are the cause
Stomach pain, discomfort, or abdomen that is constant after eating.
Sometimes you don't eat as much, or you lose weight
Symptoms of bowel cancer are also prevalent, and most people who have these symptoms do not have cancer. For example:
A change in normal bowel movements is usually caused by something eaten by a person
You probably don't have a lousy illness if you don't go to the toilet as often, or if the shit gets harder.
It may be worth trying laxatives before going to the doctor.
Rarely hard and shit
Fresh blood not in the shit itself or covering the shit.
This is often seen in pain due to hemorrhoids or minor cuts
You should be more careful about these symptoms as you age and if they persist despite simple treatments.
If you notice any of them, please contact your gp.

Protecting your child from covid-19
Covid-19 (coronavirus) can affect children as well as adults.
But few cases have been reported in children worldwide.
Children also appear to get a milder infection than adults or the elderly.
They often have no symptoms.
Children do not spread the virus more than adults, and they rarely cause the virus to spread in families.
Read here what to do if your child has covid-19 symptoms.
If you are worried about your child's health, call your gp.
Protecting your child
The most important things you can do to protect your child are:
Follow the advice on how to protect yourself and others from covid-19
Watch out for covid-19 symptoms - if your child has covid-19 symptoms, they will need to isolate themselves and call their gp
Encourage your child to wash their hands regularly and properly
Clean and disinfect all surfaces in your home and all areas where people touch them.
Do not forget the hands of the doors, the remote control and the toilet.
Follow the advice to prevent your child from getting or spreading viral infections
Face and child covers
Face covers are not recommended for children under 13.
Young children may not be able to follow the advice of wearing a mask properly.
They should wear a face mask if advised to do so by a doctor or healthcare worker, for example, when attending a hospital clinic.
Children over 13 should follow the advice given to adults about wearing face masks.
They must wear face covers when entering a shop or when travelling on public transport and should wear a face cover whenever it is difficult to stay 2 meters away from others.
All secondary school children should wear face cover in secondary school, even if they are under 13.
It is because they are at the same stage of development as their peers and can follow the advice on face cover properly.
See how your children should wash their hands
If your child has symptoms of coronavirus
This advice is usually for infants and children under 12 or 13 years of age attending primary school.
Secondary school children with symptoms should follow the adults' advice on when to contact their gp for a covid-19 (coronavirus) test.
Keep your child at home
Do not allow your child to go to school or attend a childcare centre if they have covid-19 symptoms.
He may have to stay away from others.
This will depend on the symptoms.
Read more about when a child should be kept home from school or a childcare centre.
When to seek emergency medical help
Read more about the symptoms in children and infants who need emergency medical help.
If your child suddenly becomes very ill, it is unlikely to be a coronary virus.,
The symptoms may be caused by another illness.
If your baby is under three months old and has a high temperature (38 degrees celsius or more), call 999 or 112.
If your baby is between 3 and 6 months old and has a high temperature, contact your gp immediately.

Temperature 38 degrees celsius or more
New cough - they can be coughs of any kind, not just dry
Loss or change in taste or smell

Call a gp - they will tell you if your child needs a covid-19 test.
Everyone living with your child should restrict their movements.
This means they cannot go to school, childcare or work until it is safe.
Test your child's symptoms at home.
The child should only leave the house to be tested or to see a doctor.
Call your gp first.
Do not take your child to the doctor unless the doctor says so.

After 48 hours, your child can return to school or a childcare centre as long as:
His symptoms do not get worse
It does not come with new signs
Does not require paracetamol or ibuprofen for 48 hours - this may mask a fever if it is
No one else living with it has been ill or has tested positive for covid-19
Thorny or sneezing nose

If your child has a long-term breathing illness that has brought worse:
Keep your child away from others
Everyone living with your child should restrict their movements

If this happens, your child should behave as if they have covid-19.
This is done to keep others safe.
It is not possible to be sure that your child does not have the virus.
He will have to continue to stay away from others.
He will have to remain alone until he meets both of these conditions:
Without high temperature (38 degrees celsius or more) for five days

Your gp may refer you to a hub for face-to-face assessment if:
You feel your symptoms are getting worse
You think that you cannot manage your symptoms of illness at home
You are worried about your breathing - such as shortness of breath or pain or distress
You are concerned about other diseases you already have
The hubs are for people aged 16 and over.
If you are worried about your child or the symptoms of their illness, call your gp.
The community assessment hubs help to manage an increasing number of cases of coronavirus in the community.
When to call your gp
Your gp or out-of-hours gp will decide if you need a face-to-face consultation at a hub.

Visiting nursing homes and residential care centres
People living in nursing homes and residential care facilities can have two of your le 4 have a weekly visit, provided the facility has a high level of vaccination.
This is done in compassionate circumstances under level 5 restrictions.
Covid-19 can spread quickly and can do a lot of harm if received in a nursing home or residential care centre (scf).
You can spread the virus, even if you only have mild symptoms, or if you have no symptoms or even if you feel well.
If you have recently arrived in ireland from britain or south africa, stay alone for 14 days and not visit a nursing home or residential care centre.
Visits
The arrangements for visiting residents in nursing homes and residential care centres are as follows:
One visit per week from one person under level 3 and level 4 restrictions
One fortnightly visit from one person under level 5 - for critical and compassionate reasons only
Level 5 restrictions apply in the state.
The visit should only last an hour.
It is not necessary to visit the same person every time.
It is the resident 's choice whether or not to admit a visitor.
Talk to staff if a more extended visit is required, for example, at the end of life.
In cases like this, more than one visitor may arrive.
If you have to visit in critical and compassionate circumstances, you should follow the advice below in the interests of keeping everyone safe.
Critical and compassionate visits
Additional visits for critical and compassionate circumstances may be permitted in cases such as:
End of life
If a resident is very worried or upset and a visit from someone close to them may put them at ease
If there is an important event in the life of the resident
If you do not have the opportunity to visit again for a few months or years, for example, if you are leaving the country or nearing the end of your life.
If you have to make financial or other arrangements or to advocate on behalf of the resident
Outdoor visits
Outdoor visits are permitted, as long as people stay two meters apart (social separation) at all times and if the resident is able to get outdoors.
Such visits must be arranged in advance.
Visits at the window
It is always possible to talk to residents outside of their open windows or on the phone but stay a safe distance from each other.
Such visits must be arranged in advance.
Before you visit
The nursing home will usually seek the contact details of named visitors in advance.
Check in advance if it is ok to visit.
The staff will probably give you a specific time.
You will have to come and go at the agreed times.
You will be asked a number of questions before you visit to make sure you have no covid 19 sign.
Your temperature may be raised before you enter the centre.
The management of the centre has the right to decide whether or not you can visit.
If you are unable to visit your relative, it may worry you.
The restrictions are in place to keep you, your family member and the healthcare staff safe.
Sometimes a resident may have to leave with the visitor to deal with something very important such as some personal need, the death of a family member or a visit to a family grave.
A plan will be prepared to keep the resident as safe as possible for themselves and other residents.
Read about how to take care of your mental health during a coronary virus outbreak.
During your visit
You will need to wear a face cover or medical mask during your visit.
The cover should be left on you even if you are alone and 2 meters apart.
In some cases, it is best to remove the mask:
If it is too difficult to communicate with your family and wear the mask
If your relative is unable to identify you with the mask on you
If the mask offends your loved one
If you have trouble wearing a face mask, you can wear face masks.
Cells are not as good as face cover and may not give you or your family the same protection, but they will give you some protection.
You may also be asked to wear a protective apron.
You must adhere to the advice on protecting yourself and others against covid-19
Wash your hands properly when entering and leaving patients
You can bring a gift or anything else they want.
Each visit usually lasts 1 hour.
If you need a more extended visit for compassionate circumstances, talk to staff about it.
If an outbreak of the crown virus breaks out
If a covid-19 outbreak breaks out at the centre or facility, visits will be suspended for some time.
One person will be able to make one fortnightly visit to residents under level 5 restrictions.
Exceptions will be made in special cases, for example, if a person is in danger of death or if the outbreak is in a particular place.
You can discuss this with the team.
Times you should not visit
Do not visit if:
You have been told that you are a close contact with someone with the coronavirus
You have any signs of coronavirus or any other infection such as a cold or flu
You have signs of gastroenteritis, such as diarrhea and vomiting
If you have any of these illnesses, you should wait at least 2 days after the signal has gone before you visit.
If you are a close contact, you will need to stay alone for 14 days.
If you have been tested for covid-19, do not visit until you have been told that it is safe to do so.

Why diet and nutrition help your health
It is important for all of us to eat healthy food.
It helps us stay as healthy as we can.
But eating healthy food is sometimes not easy.
Only a third of the irish population eat the recommended amount of vegetables, salads and fruit every day.
Many people eat unhealthy food, such as chocolate, cakes and biscuits, every day.
In ireland, 62% of the adult population is overweight or obese.
One in four children is seven years old, overweight or obese.
Benefits of healthy eating
Healthy eating will help you avoid certain diseases.
If you have kids, they will follow your good example of eating healthy food.
Eating healthy food can lead to the following.
Healthy weight
Healthy weightless risk of developing type 2 diabetes, heart disease and cancer
Healthy cholesterol level
A better understanding of well-being
Diet, nutrition and your body
Food contains nutrients such as protein, fat and vitamins.
Your body needs the right mix of nutrients to be healthy and wholesome.
Different foods contain different nutrients.
If you choose a combination of foods every day, you will be able to get all the nutrients you need to grow and be healthy.
That ’ s what a balanced diet means.
The same types of nutrients are grouped as follows:
Vegetables, salads and fruit
Wholegrain cereals and bread, potatoes, pasta and rice
Low-fat milk, yoghurt and cheese
Fat-free meat, poultry, fish, eggs, beans and nuts
Fats, spreads and oils
The body gets energy (calories) from the food you eat.
If you take in more calories than you use, you will gain weight and become overweight.
If you do not take in enough calories, you will be below normal weight.
Either of these is bad for your health.
Eat healthy food
Making small changes to your diet can make a big difference to your health now and in the future.
Treat the symptoms of coronavirus at home
There is no specific treatment for covid-19, but some covid-19 symptoms can be treated at home.
80% of people will recover at home - they will not have to go to the hospital.
The vaccines will be delivered in stages, and therefore, it will take some time to vaccinate the entire population.
If you experience symptoms of illness, you should self-isolate to prevent the spread of covid-19.
Call your gp or gp out of hours to discuss your symptoms of illness and find out if a covid-19 test is needed.
The most important thing you can do is make sure you do not spread the coronavirus to others.
It is extremely important to protect people at the greatest risk.
You should:
Remaining in self-isolation
Plenty of sleep
Drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration.
The color of your urine should be light yellow or clean
Eat healthy
Do not smoke
Keep warm
Keep an eye on and treat your symptoms
Read more about:
Fever
Cough - any cough is not just a dry cough
Shortness of breath
Altered or lost smell
If your symptoms get worse
Call your gp if you do not feel well.
If you are over 60 or have a condition that puts you at greater risk from coronavirus, keep a close eye on your symptoms.
Call your gp immediately if they do not get worse.
Medications to treat symptoms of illness
The medicines used will depend on:
The symptoms of illness
You have another medical condition
Any other medications you are taking
Paracetamol or ibuprofen will help to lower your temperature and treat your pains.
Paracetamol is the main medication recommended as a medical treatment for most people.
Before taking any medication, be sure to read the information on the accompanying leaflet.
Follow the advice given to you by a health professional.

Iobúproifein
It is okay to take ibuprofen or other anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) if you have the coronary virus.
There is no evidence that they are unsafe.
Only take one of the anti-inflammatory drugs at a time.
It is okay to take paracetamol and an anti-inflammatory drug at the same time.

Healthy food for families
Children grow fast, so they need food to get the right amount of energy, protein and other nutrients.
Eating healthy food will help children grow, learn and play.
It will also help prevent various illnesses, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer when they grow up.
You can use the food pyramid to plan meals and snacks for children over 5 years old.
How to eat well
Types of healthy food
Sometimes it is difficult for busy families to eat good food every day.
But good habits that children learn at home will stay with them for the rest of their lives.
What children are advised to eat according to the food pyramid:
Healthy food for children
Every parent wants the best for their child as they grow up.
What young children eat and drink is important for their health now and in the future.
Healthy school lunch
It is sometimes difficult to provide a healthy, interesting lunch that school children would enjoy. Children get one-third of their daily nutritional needs from their lunch, so it ’ s important to do some thinking and planning about it.
How to make healthier choices
Making healthy choices is often not easy.
It doesn ’ t have to be perfect.
It involves making changes.
Stick with them, and you will succeed.
Good habits that our children learn at home will stay with them for a lifetime.
Small changes in diet and activity for children can make a big difference to their future health.
If your kids see that you are active and eating healthy food at all times, they are more likely to do the same.
The right weight for your child
Many children in ireland (about one in five) are overweight.
Many parents are unaware that their children are carrying too much weight.
For the most part, eating more food than they need to grow and activity will add up weight.
If children are overweight, it can create health problems for them in the future.
Ask your gp or nurse to measure your child's weight and height during your next visit.
They will be able to tell you if your child is overweight or obese.
They will use a growth chart to find out if your child is currently overweight or overweight.
If your child is overweight if they reduce the amount of food they eat and become more active, they will achieve the right weight.
Check your child's body mass index (bmi) on the nhs healthy weight calculator.
You can also use this calculator to check your own bmi to see if you have a healthy weight.
It becomes difficult to talk to your child about weight.
When talking about weight with your child, it is important to emphasize health.

The death of a person and the grief that follows during the outbreak of the coronavirus
We need to adhere to the social separation and other measures caused by the outbreak of the coronavirus (covid-19). Things have to be done differently now that someone related to us dies.
A confidential support line is available from the irish hospice foundation and the hse.
If you need more support, use one of the telephone or online mental health support services available to you.
If your grief is getting worse, or you are having trouble sleeping, talk to your gp.
Talk to your gp, if you are seriously worried or have difficulty sleeping.
Funeral / funeral
We cannot spend time together in groups during the outbreak.
This means that we cannot have a grand funeral / funeral.
Those at the funeral must also follow the guidelines for social separation.
This means that people have to wait for two meters (6.5 feet) apart.
You should not go to a funeral if you are self-isolated or need to restrict your movements.
Death affects every family.
We know that these arrangements make matters even more difficult, but we are trying to protect everyone.
The funeral director and your priest, minister etc, will know what to do.
Advice for those who are sad at this time
The death of someone close to us hurts us all.
It can affect your mental health.
There is no right or wrong way to deal with death.
You may feel many different emotions.
Release your feelings and handle them in a way that suits you best.
This is part of the way we deal with death.
Stay in touch with others.
We cannot be together in groups at this time.
Because of this, you may not be able to meet people who want to sympathize with you.
While you may be physically separated from your normal support network, do not cut yourself off from them.
Let people express their sympathy and let them support you in different ways.
Phone calls, texts, emails, and support messages on social media from the people closest to you can comfort you.
Contact them and make sure to contact someone every day.
Answer their calls and answer their messages.
Stay in touch with the people who offend you, but if the messages of support are excessive for you, there is no need to reply to them.
While it is important to stay in touch, do not do so until you are ready.
Eat healthy food
Try not to neglect what is necessary.
Even if your stomach is not good, try to eat healthy food and drink plenty of water.
This will help you stay physically fit while you are sad.
Do the daily routines
It may help you to maintain normal habits.
Try to do the things you normally do every day, as much as you can.
It is important that you do these things at the same times, eat a meal, get up and go to bed and so on.
Go out in the garden or on your balcony to get some fresh air, if you can.
Live day today
You may feel okay on certain days, and the sadness may not be as bad as on other days - that's normal.
Some people may feel guilty when this happens, but there is no need for that.
Try to be nice to yourself and understand your feelings every day.
This happens naturally when a person is grieving a death.
Caring for bereaved children
If children in your family are sad, keep an eye on them.
Answer their questions honestly.
Children are better able to handle a sad story when they are told the truth.
Children may be sad one minute and happy the next.
Let them follow their own course.
There is no right or wrong way to show their sadness.
Try to give honest, age-appropriate information about death.
Let the kids guide you.
Let their questions guide the conversation.
Don ’ t worry if you can ’ t answer every question they ask.
Tell them you will get the information for them and try to start the conversation again when you have the answers.
If you think it's timely, start talking about the person who died and their memories of that person.
Limit news and social media
Try to limit the amount of news and social media you watch.
When you are sad, the news may upset you and make you or your family even sadder.
Ways to help others who are grieving
To help a friend or family member of you who is grieving, think about how you can extend your condolences to them at this time.
There are other ways you can comfort them if you are not in their company.
Text or call - ask your friend how they are, ask them what could help them and listen carefully
Leave food or a gift at the door as a sign of consolation
Offer practical help, for example, shopping
Offer assistance with technology such as video calls, whatsapp or other ways to keep in touch
Express your condolences online on rip.ie or similar
Write a card
Whichever way you choose to express your sympathy, be sure to contact them.
Let them know that you are available not only in the short term but in the coming weeks and months.
Remember that the person may not always want to talk to you.
That's okay too - it's important to give them space.
It is also important for them to know that you are there when they need you most.

What happens during a test for the coronavirus
There are 28 test centers nationwide.
Most centers are in a building or clinic.
Some have a drive-in service.
The test takes about 15 minutes.
If you do not feel well enough to drive to the test centre, someone in your family can drive you there.
If your child has a test appointment, you can drive them to the test centre.
Follow the advice on respiratory hygiene and social separation and wear a face mask in the test centre and on your way to the test center and home.
Test centre
Don't go to a test centre unless you have an appointment - you will not be tested.
Park and stay in your car.
A healthcare worker will come to you.
You will be given a mask to put on, they will explain to you what will happen, they will ask you some questions, and you will be taken to the test centre.
You will be asked to wash your hands properly.
Healthcare staff will take some personal details from you, including your telephone number.
This will be done to contact you with your results.
You will be asked to blow your nose into a tissue and then place the tissue in a bin.
A healthcare worker will take a sample inside your mouth and from your nose with a swab.
This will be sent to a laboratory for testing.
You will then have to drive home and stay alone.
Car service test centre
Some have a drive-in service.
You can drive yourself if you feel good enough.
If not, you can be driven by someone else, maybe someone in your family.
If you have a child who has a test appointment, you can drive them to the test center.
Do not go to a car service test centre unless you are in a car with an appointment - you will not be tested unexpectedly.

A healthcare worker will come to your home with test kits.
They will use a swab to take a sample inside your mouth and nose.
You will be asked to provide them with some personal details - these will be required so that we can send you your results.
Test results
You will receive your test results on text, but if you get a positive result, you will also be called.
When you get your results
Most people get test results within 2 days but sometimes it takes longer.
People who are seriously ill in hospital will get their results first.
Do not call your gp to get the test results.
It is important to keep the phone lines free for people seeking advice on symptoms of illness.
If you did the test because you had symptoms
If you have not received your test results, you can stop self-isolation if you meet both of these conditions:
Have you not had a fever (38 degrees celsius or above) in the last 5 days
That 10 days have passed since the symptoms first came to you
If you took the test because you were a close contact
If you are a close contact and have no symptoms continue to restrict your movements (stay at home) for 14 days.
Do this from the last date you were in contact with the person who tested positive for covid-19.
If you are unsure of the date, restrict your movements to the date the contact tracking team told you to do so.
You can stop restricting your movements when both of these conditions apply:
You tested negative for your test (covid-19 was not detected) 10 days after you last contacted the person who tested positive.
You do not have covid-19 symptoms
Living with a close contact
If you live with a close contact, you do not have to restrict your movements while waiting for their test or test results.
Pregnancy and covid-19
We are still learning about covid-19 (coronavirus).
We don ’ t really understand how it hurts pregnant women and their babies.
Our knowledge to date indicates that pregnant women are not at risk if they receive covid-19.
Our knowledge to date shows that the risk of getting the virus during pregnancy is no greater than for women of the same age who are not pregnant.
Contact your local hospital if you are worried that your baby is not moving as much as usual or if you are worried about their well-being.
The hospital will perform tests to confirm that your baby is ok.
Protecting yourself and your baby
To protect yourself and your baby, you should carefully follow the advice below:
Wash hands properly
Social separation
Stay at home
Call your gp for advice if you have any of the symptoms of the coronavirus.
If you get covid-19
If you test positive for covid-19, contact your maternity unit or hospital.
The hospital will be able to monitor your pregnancy if you get the virus properly.
Pregnant women usually have mild symptoms when they receive covid-19.
They have a normal birth and are at low risk of giving their infants covid-19.
Contact your local hospital if you are worried that your baby is not moving as much as usual or if you are worried about their well-being.
The hospital will perform tests to confirm that your baby is ok.
If you have covid-19 symptoms, you will most likely need to go into hospital and the intensive care unit.
You may be at greater risk of becoming prematurely or having a stillbirth, if you have symptoms than if you have no symptoms.
Covid plaintitis and stillbirth
There is a link between a tiny number of stillbirths and an illness known as covid plasticitis.
Covid plasticitis occurs when the plaque is infected with covid-19.
This interferes with the placenta's ability to give the baby oxygen and nutrients.
Stillbirth is mostly linked to covid plaquepox when covid-19 infection rates are very high.
As the covid-19 infection rate falls, this will not be a concern.
Contact your maternity unit or hospital immediately if you notice that your baby is not moving normally.
A high fever during pregnancy
Symptoms of coronavirus include fever (high temperature).
This may create difficulties for you during the first trimester (weeks 0 to 13).
If you experience a high temperature during your pregnancy, call your gp or midwife.
When you become pregnant, your body's immune system gradually changes.
This happens in order for your pregnancy to have a successful outcome.
You could get more infections more quickly because you are pregnant.
All pregnant women should get the following vaccines:
Whooping cough vaccine
Flu vaccine
Covid-19 vaccine - when you get the offer
Before your child is born
The staff caring for you should make sure that you are involved in all decisions that are made.
If you are worried about your pregnancy, call your hospital for advice.
Maternity hospitals have helplines open to advise you at any time.
That said, you should go to the hospital if you have any concerns about the movement of your unborn baby.
More information on: Mychild.ie
Appointments and scanning
Antenatal care continues to be provided in hospitals.
If you are receiving care in the hospital and from your gp, continue with this.
A number of appointments are made over the phone, followed by a short hospital visit.
You will need to go to the hospital for examinations, a blood test and an ultrasound scan.
You should go it alone to reduce the number of people in the hospital.
Fetal anatomy scan - scanned at 20 weeks
The fetal anatomical scan is usually performed between 18 and 22 weeks of pregnancy.
It is also called an anomaly scan.
A birth partner is usually able to attend the fetal anatomy scan with you.
This will depend on the hospital and current government restrictions.
A prior check with the hospital is required.
If your birth partner is unable to attend, you will be explained why.
If you have a coronary virus before your baby is born
If you have a coronary virus, your healthcare team will be much more careful.
This will continue before, during and after the birth of your baby.
Your obstetrician or midwife will talk to you about the safest way and time to give birth.
Other doctors with expertise may be involved in your care.
This could be a doctor dealing with infectious diseases and a neonatal doctor - that is, a doctor who deals with newborn babies.
You may be cared for in an isolation room with an en-suite during your labour.
You may have to stay in this room while you are in hospital.
During the birth of your baby and the childbirth
In most cases, your partner will be able to be present during the birth of your child.
Every effort will be made to ensure that your partner is present at the birth, but in some hospitals, your partner may not be able to attend.
There are restrictions to keep everyone safe.
If your partner can be with you, they will need to wear personal protective clothing to reduce the risk of infection.
You will not need to wear a face mask during childbirth and birth.
But, you will need to wear a mask when you are outside your room.
After the birth of your child
Visitors to the hospital
No visitor is allowed in any maternity unit.
These restrictions are in the interests of your safety and the safety of your child.
These restrictions will be lifted as soon as possible.
Going home early
Many women choose to go home early because of the restrictions on hospital visitors.
Phone support from postpartum midwives is available from some hospitals.
Community midwives will be making home visits wherever this is available.
Neonatal care in the neonatal intensive care unit
In most neonatal intensive care units (nicus), only a 15-minute visit is now allowed.
This is being done to protect vulnerable infants.
These restrictions will be lifted when it is safe to do so.
Some units have the technology to enable parents to have contact with their infants.
If you have a coronary virus after the birth of your baby
If you have covid-19, your doctor or midwife will discuss your options after giving birth.
One option is for someone else to take care of your baby until the covid-19 is gone.
This is recommended to protect your baby from covid-19.
This care could be provided by a family member or healthcare worker.
This could be provided at home or in hospital.
It is not known how long this will last.
The advice will depend on your symptoms of illness and the results of the test you will have.
Taking care of your baby if you have covid-19
If you choose to take care of your baby, the doctor or midwife will explain the danger to you.
You and your baby will be placed in an isolation room with an en-suite bathroom.
Your baby will be inside an incubator in your room.
This is a unique cradle made of plastic.
It keeps the lovely infant warm.
You will be able to see your baby inside the incubator.
When you take your baby out of the incubator to be fed, washed, or otherwise cared for, you must:
Dress with long sleeves and wear a surgical mask
Wash your hands properly and often with soap and water or rubbing alcohol - before and after handling your baby
Your child should be monitored for signs of infection.
This will continue for 14 days from the last time you had contact with your baby.
If your child shows any signs of infection, they will need to be tested.
Mental health
Perinatal mental health services are available for women with mental health problems and:
Planning a pregnancy
Who is pregnant
Having a child under one year of age
Signs of the crown virus
Restrictions remain in place to protect us from covid-19.
Read about current government restrictions on gov.ie
If you have any signs of covid-19 (coronavirus) you should stay alone and call your gp immediately.
Your doctor will tell you if a covid -19 test needs to be fixed.
Read about how to set up a test.
The others in the house will have to restrict their movements (stay at home).
Common signs
The most common symptoms of coronavirus are:
Fever (high temperature 38 degrees celsius or more)
Cough - any kind of cough, it does not have to be dry
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
Things are not the same taste or smell – this means that you have noticed that you are not getting the smell or taste of anything or that you are not getting a normal smell or taste
You may have no symptoms for 14 days.
The symptoms are very similar to those of a cold or flu.
If your gp detects the virus in time, you will be able to take steps to control the spread of the virus.
Call the emergency services at 112 or 999 if you have shortness of breath.
For example, if your breath is so bad, you can't finish a sentence.
Meadow fever
Meadow fever is an allergic reaction caused by pollen coming into contact with your mouth, nose, eyes and throat.
Pollen is a delicate plant powder.

Various things can be done to tame the symptoms of illness during a period of high pollen count.
To tame the symptoms of hay fever:
Vaseline around your pores to catch the pollen
Wear wrapped sunglasses to protect the eyes from pollen
Have a shower after being outdoors, and change your clothes to get rid of pollen
Stay inside if possible
Keep windows and doors closed if possible

Don't spend too much time outside
Do not keep in the house
Don't smoke and stay away from smokers - it makes the symptoms worse
Do not dry your clothes outdoors - for fear of falling into pollen

You will gradually gain immunity from the pollen..
This treatment is usually done in the winter about 3 months before the start of the hay fever season.
Protect yourself and others from the coronavirus
There is no vaccine for the coronavirus.
Think about the way the crown virus spreads to protect you and others (covid-19).
Coronavirus is spread by sneezing or coughing.
It must pass from the nose or mouth of an infected person into your eyes, nose or mouth to get the virus.
This can happen directly or indirectly (on hands, objects, surfaces).
Remember this.
It will help you remember all the things you need to do to protect yourself and others from the virus.
Level 3 restrictions apply in every county in the state.

Shopping safely during the coronary virus outbreak
The biggest danger of shopping is being in contact with an infected person.
When shopping, you should:
Wear a face cover
Practice best hygiene practices
Practice social separation
Without contact with people outside of those who live with you
Someone who passes by in the store is not much of a danger to you.
But stay away from 2 meters away as much as possible.
Face cover
By law, you must wear a face cover while shopping because it can be difficult to practice social separation while in a store.
Face covers should also be worn in busy or crowded outdoor spaces, such as a shopping street.
However, face coverage is not suitable for everyone.
It ’ s okay if certain people choose not to wear them.
Facial cover is not suitable for children under 13 or for people with special needs as they may be upset or very uncomfortable to wear.
When you should stay home
Don ’ t go out shopping if you ’ re feeling sick
If you are at greater risk from covid-19, consider doing your shopping online or ask someone to shop for you.
If you need help, you can also contact your local county council.
They have community support in place to deliver essential goods.
Read more about how local authorities can help you during the coronary virus outbreak.
Reduce the risk while shopping
Only go shopping when necessary.
This reduces the risk of contracting or spreading covid-19.
When you are shopping
Use the disinfectant provided, on your hands, the trolley or basket.
Remember to make no contact with your face.
Wear a face mask if you're over 13 - but don't wear it if you feel uncomfortable wearing it
If you cough or sneeze, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve.
Follow the guidelines for social separation - stay 2 meters away from others in queues when shopping.
Pay by card rather than cash - a contactless payment method may reduce the risk of infection.
If you use cash, the risk is low, especially if you clean your hands regularly after handling cash.
After shopping
Wash your hands properly
Save your shopping
Wash your hands again
Show respect for others
Only buy what you need - it is restocked in stores daily.
Do not go shopping during the hours set for healthcare workers and carers.
Delivery and collection services are very important for people who are cocooning and are unable to leave their homes.
Only reserve delivery times if necessary.
Shopping for a vulnerable person
How covid-19 is spread
Direct contact
Local restrictions to stop the spread of the coronavirus
You could get the virus from someone who has the virus if you have close contact with it.
It is spread in droplets from your nose and mouth, e.g. when someone is talking loudly, singing, shouting, coughing or sneezing.
This happens when people are 1 to 2 meters apart.
This is why the spread of the virus is reduced when you keep a distance of 2 meters from others.
Infected surfaces
The virus can be found from a surface that has been infected or sneezed by a person with the virus.
The virus can be present in droplets that fall on surrounding surfaces.
If you lay your hand on your eyes, nose or mouth, you could also get the virus.
This is why it is important to wash your hands properly and often.
How long the virus can survive
Simple household disinfectants can kill the virus on surfaces.
Clean the surface first, and then use a disinfectant.
The crown virus can survive for:
Up to 72 hours on plastic and stainless steel.
Less than 4 hours on copper
Less than 24 hours on cardboard
Airborne transmission
Airborne transmission is the spread of viruses in very small water particles.
This can happen over a distance longer than droplets, such as across a room.
Airborne transmission does not appear to play a major role in the spread of covid-19.
But it can happen in some cases.
To protect yourself, keep indoor spaces well ventilated (allowing fresh air in) by opening windows and doors if possible.
How to protect yourself
A face mask can protect you, but you should always do what is necessary to prevent the spread of the virus.
These include:
Social separation
Cover your cough and sneeze.
Wash your hands properly
Do not place your hands near your eyes, nose or mouth unless they are clean
The virus can quickly spread in a crowded environment.
Avoid crowded places as much as possible.
Leave a place if it is crowded and you cannot stay 2 meters away from others.
Pets and the crown virus
There is no evidence that pets such as cats and dogs can spread the coronavirus among humans.
To give yourself better protection, wash your hands often and adequately when in contact with pets.
Face mask, medical mask and disposable gloves
You are required by law to wear face cover
Public transport.
In shops, shopping centres etc - see complete list
Face cover should also be worn:
When it is not possible to stay away 2 meters from others
In hospitals, doctor's dispensary, nursing homes and at the dentist and other health centers
When people are at risk from people who are at greater risk from the coronary virus - eg people over 70 years of age or people who are vulnerable to health
There are people who should not / cannot wear face cover.
Here is a piece of cloth that covers your nose and mouth.
This coverage may restrict the spread of the coronavirus in the community.
It may help to prevent the spread of the coronavirus from sneezing or coughing in people with the virus.
They may help people who do not know they have the virus to pass on the virus to others.
Social separation
Cover your mouth and nose with a handkerchief or sleeve when coughing and sneezing.
Wash your hands often and adequately
Do not place your hands near your eyes, nose or mouth unless they are clean.
People who should not wear face cover
You do not need to wear a mask if you have an illness or particular needs and a facial covering may upset or make you uncomfortable.
Facial coverage is also not recommended for people with:
They have trouble breathing
Unconscious person or speech
A person who is unable to remove the face cover without assistance,
A person with special needs or hearing difficulties, or who is deaf
In such cases, the person will receive some protection from the cheater if he is able to throw cheaters.
But this is the only time you should spend on cells.
You will get better protection against covid-19 if you wear a cloth-covered face cover.
Children under the age of 13 are not advised to wear face masks, but some children may choose to wear one.
There is a good chance that young children will not follow the advice on how to wear face masks properly.
There is also a risk that they may not understand the importance of avoiding touching the cover.
Children under 13 should wear a mask if recommended by their doctor or health worker.
Children may be advised to wear a mask while attending a hospital clinic for example.
Children under 13 only in the first year of secondary school should wear face cover while attending school.
This is recommended because they are at the same stage of development as their peers and can properly follow the advice on face coverings.
When one should wear
You must wear face cover on public transport, by law and in:
Shops and pharmacy
Shopping centers
Libraries
Cinemas
Theaters
Concert halls
Bingo halls
Museums
Nail salon
Hairdressers and barbers
Tattoo shop and piercing
Travel agents and tour operators
Laundry centers and dry cleaners
Bookmakers
Many of these places are temporarily closed due to health risk to the public.
When you can remove the face cover
You can remove the face cover to
Talk to someone who has communication difficulties
Providing emergency assistance or care to a vulnerable person
Taking medication
You may be asked to remove the face cover to confirm your age or identity
You can also remove the face cover:
At a post office, credit union or bank
In a restaurant or cafe while eating and drinking
When you are receiving medical or dental treatment
Where it is made from
A face cover is made of cloth such as cotton or silk.
You can buy them or make them at home from items like scarves, t-shirts, fitness shirts, or towels.
How you wear a face cover
It should cover the nose and be under the chin and:
That it lies quietly and comfortably on the cheek
Be secured with an ear strap or loop
There should be at least 2 pieces of cloth
Be able to catch your breath with ease
How to store and wash face covers
Store your face cover made of cloth properly and wash it regularly to keep it clean.
Have more than one face cover, so you have a clean one if needed.
Remove it properly and clean or disinfect your hands after handling the face cover '
Storing your face cover
Storing wet or dirty face cover
If your face gets wet or dirty due to sweat, saliva, make-up or anything else, put the face cover in a tightly closed bag, and then wash it.
Wash the wet or dirty face cover as soon as possible before it becomes rotten.
Breathing through a wet face cover is not easy to breathe and is not as effective as a dry cover.
Storing dry face cover
A clean face cover can be placed safely until you have to put it on again.
Remove it properly and clean or disinfect your hands after handling it.
Keep it in a dry bag to let air through (bag made of paper or cloth) to keep it clean.
When you put it on again, keep the same side outside.
The more frequent handling of the face cover without washing it, the greater the risk of contamination.
When you remove the face cover to eat or drink something in a safe place such as your pocket, purse or paper bag.
Clean and disinfect your hands after removing the face mask.
Put on the face cover again after eating and keep the same outside.
Clean and disinfect your hands again after applying the face mask.
Washing your face cover
You should wash your face cover when it is dirty or at least daily.
If you have a one-time face cover, throw it away after you have used it once.
You do not need to sterilize face masks.
Wash it in a washing machine or by hand as you would with other clothes.
If you are using a washing machine.
Add your face covers to your regular wash
Use a regular laundry detergent and set the temperature for the type of fabric present
If you are washing by hand
Wash your face cover with water and fabric detergent or soap
Rinse thoroughly with clean water to remove the detergent or soap again
Fog on your glasses
There may be fog on your glasses when you wear the face cover.
The warm air from your breath passes out through the surface of the face cover.
This can cause fog on your glasses and make you unable to see correctly.
Cleaning your glasses will not cause as much fog.
Before you put on the face cover:
Clean your glasses with water and soap.
Shake them to remove the water from them.
Leave the glasses to air dry or dry them with a clean cloth.
Make sure the face cover is well compressed
The face cover will stop the fog on your glasses if you put them on correctly.
It doesn ’ t have to be uncomfortable but be perfectly squeezed with no gap around your nose.
Place your glasses over the face cover seal to keep your breath away from your glasses.
You may not be able to set your face cover long up enough on your face to do this..
If not, try sticking the face cover under your glasses with tape.
How to make one
To make a cloth cover at home:
Cut two tightly woven cotton rectangles, about 25cm x 15cm.
Fold and sew upper and lower edges.
Fold and sew the edges to the side, leaving a gap large enough to pass elastic.
Insert elastic 15cm long through the side edges and tie them tightly.
A hair ribbon or twine cut long enough to tie behind the head will work.
Fix the elastic knots inside the edges of the mask and grip if you need a neat finish.
How long will it last
Facial coverage should be removed when:
It no longer covers the nose and mouth
Which are ribbon, elastic, or straps stretched or damaged
He can't stay on the front
Holes in the cloth or if it is torn
How to use the face cover properly
Clean your hands properly before applying it.
Practice using it so that you are comfortable wearing and removing it.
Make sure it is made of a cloth that you are comfortable with
Cover your mouth and nose and make sure there are no gaps.
Tie it securely.
Carry clean face covers in a sealed bag that is waterproof.
Carry another similar bag to put used covers.
Do not touch your face cover when wearing it - if it does, clean your hands properly.
Do not use a wet or dirty face cover.
Do not share your face cover with others.
Don't take off your face cover for talking, eating and / or waving - if you need to expose your nose or mouth, take off the cover and put it in your used cover bag.
Do not throw away your face covers in public places.
Removing your reusable face cover
To properly remove the face cover:
Remove it from the back of your head - do not lay your hand on the piece in front of your face
Put it in a sealed bag that is watertight or wash it immediately - put disposable masks in a bin immediately
Clean your hands properly
Masks of any use
How to safely dispose of a disposable mask:
Remove it from the back of your head - do not touch the front of the mask
Throw it away immediately in a closed bin
Clean your hands with an alcohol-based disinfectant or soap and water
Throw in the general bin at home or work, or in a bin if you are out
Do not throw them in the recycling bin as they cannot be recycled
Take them home if you don't have a bin - don't throw them away on the street.
Cheat and face shield
Cells are not the best option for protecting you and others from covid-19.
They can stop some of the droplets from your mouth or nose from spreading and it is better not to throw anything away.
But you should only wear cheaters if you are ill or weakened and have difficulty wearing a face mask.
The cellulite should cover the sides of your face (from ear to ear) and down under your chin.
Reusable cells should always be cleaned after wear and kept in a clean place until you need them again.
You should wear a mask if
You have the coronavirus, if you think you have the virus or are waiting for a test result
You are caring for someone who has or is suspected of having the crown virus
You are waiting for yourself and if you can't stay 2 meters away from other people in the house
Facial cover with valve or ventilator
A face cover with a valve or vent does not protect you from covid-19
Do not wear a face cover with valves or a fan.
The face covers are not good enough to stop the spread of the virus as you could breathe in or out of the virus through the valve or through the ventilator.
They are usually used by construction workers or artisans for dust protection.
They are not designed to prevent the spread of viruses.
Medical mask
The medical mask is for these people;
Health care workers
People who are self-isolated and cannot stay 2 meters away from others in their own home
They are also used by other workers in specific positions.
These masks are very important and are not for the general public unless a person is self-isolated and cannot stay 2 meters away from others in their home.
Wear a cloth-covered face mask when shopping and on public transport.
This will ensure that the medical masks are available to those who need them.
Disposable gloves
Do not wear disposable gloves instead of washing your hands.
The virus stays on them in the same way it stays on your hands.
Also, the virus can spread to your hands when you touch them.
Disposable gloves are worn in medical settings.
They are not as effective in everyday life.
Wearing disposable gloves may make you feel safe but this is not the case
Sneezing or coughing into gloves - this creates a new surface on which the virus can survive
Give yourself the virus when you take off your gloves or lay a hand on some surface
Not washing your hands as often as necessary and putting the contaminated gloves on your face how to wash your hands properly and avoid infection
How to clean your hands
Cleaning your hands will help control the spread of bacteria and viruses that cause infections.
Hundreds of people become ill every day in ireland from associated healthcare infections.
You could get a serious illness, even death, with these infections.
The best way to stop harmful germs from spreading is by cleaning your hands.
About 30% to 50% of infections that start in hospitals can be avoided.
Clean your hands
Use soap and water or alcohol hand gel to clean your hands regularly.
Hand disinfectants contain alcohol and are extremely flammable.
Do not use them near heat or fire.
How to wash your hands with soap and water
Wet your hands with warm water and soap.
Rub your hands together until foam is formed.
Rub the top of your hands, between your fingers and under your fingers.
Do this for about 20 seconds.
Clean your hands under running water.
Dry your hands with a clean towel or paper towel.
If you have dry skin or a problem with your skin, use a moisturizer after washing your hands and at night.
Hand hygiene at home
Make sure you wash your hands when you are at home and not in hospital:
After you use the toilet
When you clean up after your pet
Before preparing food, before handling food or before a meal
After dealing with raw meat
After using public transport
When you return home after meeting a lot of people
Cleaning your hands will help you avoid:
Colds and flu
Stomach aches such as norovirus diarrhea
Eye infections such as conjunctivitis
Bullfrogs such as mrsa and vre
Children often have these infections, parents and childcare workers should always make sure that children clean their hands regularly.
Hand hygiene in health care centres
Patients
If you are a patient with an infection, the staff will support you and tell you how to control the spread of bacteria (germs).
Follow all the instructions given to you by your doctor or nurse to help keep your infection under control.
The best way to avoid and prevent infection is to:
Clean your hands often
Do not forget to clean your hands properly after going to the toilet and before a meal
Use your own soap, flannel, sponge and razor
Do not share newspapers or anything personal with other patients
Restrict any contact with patients and stay out of bed
Tell staff if the facilities at the hospital or clinic are not clean
You are less likely to spread 'germs' at home.
But you should always keep your hands and toilet clean.
Visitors
If you are visiting a patient, clean your hands when you enter and leave the ward.
If you are making a long visit or helping a patient, clean your hands regularly while you are there.
You can use soap and water or alcohol gel available at the hospital / health center.
If there is any dirt on your hands or under your fingers, you will need to use soap and water.
You can then ensure that they are properly cleaned by using alcohol gel.
Vaccine
A vaccine reduces infections and protects you and your family.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist if your child has had all the appropriate injections.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you should get this year's flu vaccine or a vaccine to protect you from pneumonia.
This is especially important for the elderly or those with long-term health illnesses.
Stop smoking during the coronary virus outbreak
Do you already have a stop plan (quit)? Sign in
If you smoke, you are at greater risk of developing an acute respiratory infection such as the flu.
Smokers are at greater risk of getting the flu and getting a worse infection than non - smokers.
Although it is a new virus, it is now clear that people are also at risk from the coronavirus, because they smoke.
Like the flu, coronary virus may be worse for smokers,
If you smoke, you do not need self-isolation unless you have symptoms.
But you should follow the same advice as everyone else: Stay home and protect yourself from the crown virus.
This is a good time to quit smoking.
Stopping smoking will strengthen your natural defenses against all types of infections, including the coronavirus.
When you stop, the hairs in your airways (cilia) will start working again.
Within a day or two, the oxygen levels in your body will improve.
Your blood pressure and pulse will decrease, which will reduce the stress on your body.
Each of these will give you protection against the coronavirus.
How tobacco harms you
Weaker heart and lungs
Smoking affects the way your heart and lungs work, making it less easy for you to fight off an acute infection, such as the flu or the coronary virus.
Cigarette smoke damages the natural barriers to infection in the lungs, making it easier for the virus to attach to the surface of your lung and cause infection of the lung tissues.
Laying a hand on your face
The coronary virus is spread in sneezing or coughing drops, it has to go from the infected nose or mouth and into your own eyes, nose or mouth to infect you.
This can happen directly or indirectly (on hands, objects, surfaces).
Everyone is advised not to lay a hand on their face.
But when you smoke, chances are you put your hands on your face, especially your mouth.
This increases the risk of infection.
Protect yourself and others from coronavirus
Don ’ t be too close to others
Social separation is important to help curb the spread of the coronavirus.
This is done by restricting contact between potentially infected people and healthy people.
You should stay 2 meters (6.5 feet) away from others.
People tend to be close to others when they are smoking.
Quitting smoking will reduce the risk of infection.
Social separation
Sharing cigarettes
Good hygiene and handwashing are very important at the present time.
The advice of public health doctors is that we should not share things that come into our mouths, such as bottles or cups.
Cigarettes should therefore not be shared with others.
Good hygiene and hand washing.
Smoke from other people's cigarettes
Smoking indoors puts your closest people at risk because your second-hand smoke interferes with the body's natural defences to fight infections such as coronavirus.
Children in particular are at risk of second-hand smoke because they breathe faster, and their lungs, airways and immune system are still developing.
The best way to avoid this and to protect others is to quit smoking.
Get advice on how to do this from the online quit supports, get started on a personal quitplan plan or join us on facebook.

Ordinary cold
Signs of the cold
The first sign of a cold is a sore throat.
Then comes a sneezing or stuffy, sick or thoughtful nose.
One in three people who catch a cold usually have a cough and feel sick.
A cold is caused by a virus.
Antibiotics will not cure viruses.
Water disappears from the body when a person sweats or sneezes.
Therefore, it is important to drink plenty of fluids.
Take a break and eat healthily.
Do not ask your doctor for antibiotics when you have a cold.
You usually feel worse for 2-3 days before you gradually start to recover.
The symptoms of illness usually last for a week.
Cold symptoms are very similar to the symptoms of the flu, but the flu is much more serious.
Cold
It comes to you gradually
You usually feel it in your nose and throat
You feel sick but you are able to continue as normal - for example, going to work
Flu
It comes to you quickly within a few hours
You usually feel it in your nose and throat
You get tired and unable to continue as usual
Signs of the cold:
A stuffy or smoky nose
Sore throat
Headache
Muscle pains
Cough
Sneezing
High temperature
Pressure in your ears and face
You get no taste or smell of anything
Adults and children have the same symptoms.
Sometimes the symptoms last longer in children.
Causes of the cold
A cold is caused by a virus.
They spread easily among people.
You become contagious until all the symptoms are gone.
This usually takes about a week.
Coughing and sneezing spreads germs that can live on hands and surfaces for 24 hours.
To reduce the spread of a cold, do the following:
Wash your hands with warm water and soap
Cough into your elbow to make sure you don't spread germs on your hands or others
Use a tissue to catch the germs when you cough or sneeze
Throw the paper towel in the bin as soon as possible
How to avoid colds
The best ways to avoid colds are:
Wash your hands with warm water and soap, especially before meals.
Do not share towels or cups with a cold
Do not touch your eyes or nose.
You could get yourself infected if you have the virus.
Keep exercising and stay healthy
The flu vaccine protects against the flu but not the cold.
Treatment
Most colds can be treated at home.
You will recover without any special treatment.
Drink plenty of fluids, take a break and eat healthy food.
Continue as usual when you recover.
Talk to your pharmacist about the products and medicines that will help you.
Paracetamol or ibuprofen can be taken to relieve pain or fever.
A nasal spray helps to open a stuffy nose.
You may also find relief with throat sprays, lotions and cough treatments.
Be careful about taking medicines for coughs and colds if you are also taking paracetamol or ibuprofen.
That way, you could take more than the recommended dose.
There are some medications that are not suitable for children, infants and pregnant women.
Get advice from your pharmacist.
There is little evidence that nutritional supplements such as vitamin c, zinc, echinacea or garlic help to heal.
Visit your gp:
If your symptoms of illness do not improve after 3 weeks
If you have difficulty breathing or have chest pain
If your illness symptoms suddenly get worse
If you have a very high temperature or you feel very hot, and you are shaking
If you are worried about your child's symptoms of illness
If you have a long-term illness - for example, if you have diabetes, heart, lung, kidney or neurological disease
If you have a weakened immune system - for instance, if you have diabetes or are receiving chemotherapy
Antibiotics
Antibiotics will not do you any good for your symptoms of illness, and you will not recover faster.
Antibiotics are effective against bacterial infections.
Colds are a virus.
Shortness of breath
Shortness of breath may not be a concern but sometimes it can be serious and may require treatment.
You may have a heart attack or a problem with your lungs or airways.
Call a gp if you have shortness of breath:
Which lasted longer than a month
Which gets worse when you are active
Which gets worse when you lie down
You have been coughing for 3 weeks or more
That your ankles are swollen
Shortness of breath combined with high temperature may be a sign of the coronary virus.
If you have these symptoms you should call your gp.
It is important to seek medical advice to ensure that it is not serious.
You are not wasting anyone 's time checking it out.
Causes shortness of breath
There are many different causes of shortness of breath.
The most common causes include a common cold or chest, asthma, being overweight or a smoker.
It can also be a sign of a panic attack.
But sometimes it can be a sign of something more serious, such as lung cancer or the lung disease known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd).
Any treatment you need will depend on what is causing your symptoms.
Don't try to self-diagnose - always consult a gp.
Contact tracking
Contact tracking identifies people who have had close contact with someone with the coronary virus.
This is being done to reduce the spread of the coronavirus in the community.
The people who do this work are called “contact trackers ”.
If you get a positive result
If you get a positive result the contact tracker will call you to find the contact details of anyone you have been in close contact with.
If you test positive only covid-19 signals you
They will ask you about the people and places you visited 48 hours before your illness counterparts began and you began to self-isolate.
If you test positive but do not have covid-19 symptoms
The contact tracker will only ask you about people and places you visited 24 hours before your test and until you started self-isolation.
They won ’ t ask you about people who passed by on the street or in shops.
There is little danger in such situations, especially if you are practising social separation.
Contact tracking is confidential.
No-one who calls the contact administrator will know that you provided their contact details.
Covid tracker app
The contact tracker will also ask you if you have used the covid tracker app
If you have been using it, they will ask you to use the upload function again to send an alert to your immediate contacts.
You do this with the app.
It is your choice to do this.
If you consent, a separate upload code will be sent to you with a text message.
This code will release the lock on the app's upload function.
Dehydration
Your body loses more fluid than it absorbs when you are dehydrated.
This can be serious for you if you do not get medical treatment.
Children and people over 65 are at greater risk of dehydration.
You are more likely to become dehydrated if you have symptoms of flu or coronavirus.
Signs of dehydration
Symptoms of dehydration in adults and children include:
Tart
Dark yellow urine with a strong odor
Dizziness or confusion
Feeling tired
Dry mouth, lips and eyes
Little urine, and less than four times a day
Dehydration can occur more easily in the following situations:
High temperatures of 38 degrees celsius or above you
Diabetes
Vomiting or diarrhea
Spending too much time in the sun (heat stroke)
If you drink too much alcohol
Sweating a lot after exercise
Urinating more often due to medication you are taking (diuretics)
Reduce the risk of dehydration
Drink liquids when you feel any sign of dehydration.
If you can ’ t drink easily because you feel sick or if you were sick, start with small bubbles and then drink more bulbs, gradually.
You can use a spoon to help your child swallow the liquid.
You should drink enough throughout the day so that your urine has a clear light color.
Drink a drink if you are at risk of dehydration.
For example, if you are sneezing, sweating or have diarrhea.
Caregivers: Make sure the person in your care drinks enough
The person you care for may not realize that he / she is not drinking enough fluids.
To help them:
Make sure they drink during meal time
Make it a social habit, like "drinking a cup of tea"
Give them plenty of water - such as soup, ice cream or jelly, or fruit like melons
A pharmacist can help with dehydration
If you are vomiting or have diarrhea and are losing too much fluid, you need to replace the sugar, salts and minerals lost by your body.
Your pharmacist may recommend oral rehydration pouches.
This is a powder that you mix with water and then drink it.
Ask your pharmacist which ones are best for you or your child.
When to seek medical help
Contact your gp if your symptoms do not improve with treatment and:
You are feeling more tired than usual
You are confused and upset
You have dizziness that does not go away when you stand up
You did not urinate during the day
Your pulse is weak or fast
You have seizures
These are signs of severe dehydration that urgently require medical treatment.
Dehydration in children
Children under five with dehydration
Children under 5 should drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration.
Dehydration is common in young children.
This can be serious if not dealt with quickly.
Contact your gp urgently if your child:
Sleepy
Breathing fast
When your child is crying they have no tears or a few tears
Fontanelle pressed in (the soft spot on the child's head)
Dry mouth
Dark yellow urine or no urine for the last 12 hours
Cold hands and feet or a stained appearance
Once the dehydration has been treated, your baby will need to drink plenty of fluids.
Continue breastfeeding or using formula milk - try to feed a little more often than usual
Give small bubbles of water to children who are on formula or dry food
Give small children the normal diet
Give a small drop of the rehydrated solution regularly to make sure they get the lost liquid, salts and sugars, - ask your pharmacist to suggest one
Don't
Do not make the formula weaker.
Don't give young children fruit juice or fizzy drinks - it makes diarrhea or diarrhea worse.
Coronavirus - treatment
There is no specific treatment available for coronavirus.
But 80% of people will be able to recover from the coronary virus at home and will not need to go into hospital.
The vaccines will be available in stages and as a result it will take some time to vaccinate the population.
If you experience symptoms, you should self-isolated to prevent the spread of covid-19.
Call your gp or out of hours service immediately to discuss your symptoms and to determine if you need to have a covid-19 test.
The most important thing is to protect others from the virus.
Protecting those in at-risk groups from covid-19 is crucial.
Self-isolation
Get enough sleep and rest time
Drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration.
Your urine should be bright yellow or bright
Eat healthily
Do not smoke
Fan you
Keep an eye out for signs of illness and treat them
Read more about signs
Fever
Cough - any kind, not just dry cough.
Shortness of breath
Altered or lost smell
If your symptoms of illness get worse
