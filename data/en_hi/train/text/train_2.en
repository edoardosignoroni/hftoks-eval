Both are possible. But I take the half - year long flirtation seriously for three reasons. First, Erdoğan has established a record of straight talk, leading one key columnist, Sedat Ergin, to call the Jan. 25 statement perhaps his “most important” foreign policy proclamation ever. < s > Second, as Turkish columnist Kadri Gürsel points out, “The EU criteria demand democracy, human rights, union rights, minority rights, gender equality, equitable distribution of income, participation and pluralism for Turkey. SCO as a union of countries ruled by dictators and autocrats will not demand any of those criteria for joining. ” Unlike the European Union, Shanghai members will not press Erdoğan to liberalize but will encourage the dictatorial tendencies in him that so many Turks already fear. < s > Third, the SCO fits his Islamist impulse to defy the West and to dream of an alternative to it. The SCO, with Russian and Chinese as official languages, has a deeply anti - Western DNA and its meetings bristle with anti - Western sentiments. For example, when Iran 's President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad addressed the group in 2011, no one rejected his conspiracy theory about 9 / 11 being a U. S. government inside job used “as an excuse for invading Afghanistan and Iraq and for killing and wounding over a million people. ” Many backers echo Egyptian analyst Galal Nassar in his hope that ultimately the SCO “will have a chance of settling the international contest in its favor. ” Conversely, as a Japanese official has noted, “The SCO is becoming a rival block to the U. S. alliance. It does not share our values. ” 2007

Missionery position is the most popular and traditional sex position. According to a survey, 91 percent of th people usually use this sex position most of the time. In this position there is maximum closeness between the man and the woman. Missionery position is considered to be the maximum frequent, maximum natural and maximum favourite position in the sex between two persons of opposite sexes. For achieving this position the woman lies down on her back spreading her legs (or with the legs closed, not spread), then the man comes above her, going near her repeats the act of entry. during this he supports his body weight with his hands. In this position the man has got complete freedom to decide the speed and method with which he will perform the sex act. During the sex act, if he comes very close (bending down) to the woman, then during this process some of his weight comes on the upper part of the woman 's body and he can experience leisure or ease. In this position, the woman can use the middle portion of her body, with the help of her legs, for the thrusts (when she is in the state of great sex excitement or if she wants to enjoy hard thrusts) or she can entwine her legs in the man' s waist and can slow down his speed. During this intercourse game, as the faces of the man and the woman are very close in this position, kissing can also be done nicely. But if the woman is pregnant, she should avoid this position. Also people with back pain also may avoid this position. For a woman suffering from back pain, a towel can be made into a round shape and kept below the back and a pillow can be kept below the thighs and the sex can then be done. This is a maximum prevalent position in India. In rurul areas 100 percent people follow this position.
