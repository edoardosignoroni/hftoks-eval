In the first two months after the corona infection spread in the state, the hospital started experiencing a huge shortage of PPE kits and masks.
PPE kits, masks were the shield of health workers in the war against corona.
However, a member of the Mard, an association of resident doctors at the Mumbai Municipal Hospital, Dr. Deepak Mundhe says, "There may have been a shortage of PPE kits elsewhere in the state except Mumbai.
In India, coronavirus is more prevalent among people from abroad.
We needed to seal the international border.

Corona, a resident doctor at the municipal hospital, was providing medical services to patients in March, April and May.
Dr. Nagpur. Lina Kalmegh says, "It cannot be said that government hospitals failed during the Corona period.

* Controlled hospital treatment
* Toll free number announced after increasing demand for drugs like Remedivir.
* Steps taken to control prices of N-95 masks.
* RTPCR test made available at affordable rates.

Budget: Why and how did Maharashtra's economic situation deteriorate?
The state budget will be presented to the legislature today (March 8).
If the question of which is the number one state in the country is asked, different claims are likely to be made by the ruling party and the opposition in Maharashtra.
However, your Maharashtra is not the number one state in the country at present.
The states of Haryana, Telangana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are far ahead of Maharashtra in terms of GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product).
Looking at the economic survey reports released in the last 10 years, the state was in good shape till 2013.
But from 2012-13, the situation began to change.
After that, however, Maharashtra could not maintain the number one position.
Why and how it happened.
Although Maharashtra's growth rate has not increased faster than other states, it has not slowed down.
Neglect of agriculture
But if we study by sector, the agribusiness in Maharashtra has shown negative growth in the last few years, says Dr. Aditi says.
Spraying without safety devices
Some of the research I have done on agriculture has come to light.
The main reason why Maharashtra is lagging behind
There are various reasons why Maharashtra's economy is lagging behind other states, said senior economist Dr. Yashwant Thorat speaks to BBC Marathi.
Here are 5 key reasons why.
Lack of proper policies
Lack of proper spending
Lack of properly trained workers
Corruption
Lack of strategic decisions to strengthen the state’s economy
If our policies and spending are not sustainable, it is detrimental to the state if the policies and spending we are doing are not reflected on the ground, says Thorat.
"The governments that came to Maharashtra after 2010 did not spend the funds properly.
Thorat feels that the state's fiscal deficit is huge, but if the money had been spent in the right place, it would have paid off.
'Why is Maharashtra lagging behind in trained manpower?'
Speaking on the issue of workers, Thorat recounts his experiences.
He says, "Many churches come to us to ask for jobs.
He recounts his experience in a hotel in Konkan.
As an Indian, I am happy that people from the Northeast have come to work in Konkan.
Proper manpower training is the issue.
After agriculture, construction industry is the most important sector in Maharashtra in terms of job creation, she says.
The most important sector in terms of job creation in Maharashtra is the construction industry.
But this area can be revived, said Dr. Aditi thinks.
Currently, the Maharashtra government has significantly relaxed the stamp duty.
Failure to attract industries
Thorat also feels that there is a lack of policies in Maharashtra to attract industries.
Maharashtra used to have all kinds of industries.
"The corona makes no one visible at the gateway
At the same time, corruption is one of the main reasons.
At the same time, Dr. Aditi points out the declining importance of the Mumbai port in the last few years.
The port of Mumbai is a very important destination for international maritime traffic.
'Tourism can save Maharashtra'
The state of Maharashtra has a huge historical, religious and natural heritage.
Caves of Ajanta Ellora
Compared to Maharashtra, the states in South India have strengthened their economy through tourism by conserving religious and historical sites.
'Maharashtra will be No. 1 again'
But Rajesh Kshirsagar, chairman of the state's planning board, blames the previous government for the situation.
Uddhav Thackeray, Devendra Fadnavis, Shiv Sena, BJP
In the last five years, the BJP government has focused on how all the economy in Maharashtra will go to Gujarat.
But global economic growth is slowing, as are oil prices.
Meanwhile, Kshirsagar claims that "the government is now paying more attention to how investment has increased.

However, current coronary heart disease does not appear to have reduced the infection so quickly.
Dr. Speaking to BBC Marathi, Bhondwe said, "There is no rush for preventive vaccination against corona.
Or it may have occasional outbreaks in those areas.
The corona vaccine does not mean that the disease will go away immediately.
'The second wave of corona is coming', the Center gave 15 suggestions to Maharashtra
The second wave of corona has started in Maharashtra, the secretary of the Union Ministry of Health has sent a letter to Maharashtra.
Very little efficient efforts are being made in contact tracing, segregation, segregation and testing, the health secretary lamented.
A team from the Union Health Department visited various parts of Maharashtra from March 7 to 11 and inspected the situation there.
The second wave of corona begins in Maharashtra - Central Government
In a summary written at the end of the letter, the Union Health Secretary said that the second wave of Kovid 19 global epidemic has started in Maharashtra.
Not much active efforts are being made to locate, trace and isolate patients and quarantine those who come in contact with them.
In order to prevent or stop this spread of covid, the administrative mechanism should be activated in August-September 2020, the Center said in its letter.
All key components and guidelines outlined in the following instructions should be strictly followed.
15 instructions given by the central team to the state government:
1) Working groups should be set up once again under the leadership of District Collector and Municipal Commissioner to prevent infection and transmission of Corona virus.
2) Patients and those who come in contact with them should be searched from door to door in the containment areas.
3) At least 20 to 30 persons who came in contact with a patient who tested positive should be traced.
4) The number of corona tests needs to be increased.
5) The policies for containment should be reconsidered.
6) The policy of keeping 80 to 85 per cent of the active cases in home isolation should be reviewed.
7) While isolating the patient at home, it should be checked whether any of the family members who are quarantined at home are in the high-risk group.
8) Even if the infrastructure in the health system is adequate now, it should be prepared by considering what will be needed if the situation worsens.
9) Treatment protocols should be reviewed with the doctors treating the patients.
10) The number of deaths of patients admitted for treatment in Vasantrao Pawar Medical College, Nashik is high.
11) Death audit should be resumed.
12) Frontline workers are not keen on vaccination.
13) The state government needs to speed up the vaccination of senior citizens and those with chronic diseases.
14) A large public awareness campaign should be carried out to know what precautions should be taken while using to prevent covid 19.
15) Measures like night curfew, weekend lockdown do not have much effect in preventing or controlling the infection.
Corona virus: How and why is the number of covid 19 patients increasing in Maharashtra?
Remember the game of hide and seek? The one who has the kingdom in it is trying to find those who are hiding.
Is corona virus playing a similar game in Maharashtra at present?
Epidemiologists call this the 'second wave' of epidemics.
What is the exact status of Kovid-19 epidemic in the state?
Rapid increase in the number of patients in Maharashtra
In Maharashtra, the eruption of Kovid had reached its peak in September last year.
See this graph from January.
As many as 25,681 corona patients were registered during the day on Friday, March 19.
Outbreaks appear to be exacerbated in rural areas
When Kovid came to Maharashtra, initially the number of patients was higher in urban areas.
Amravati had about 3,000 active patients on September 24 when the rate of infection was at its highest during the first wave of the epidemic.
In the rural areas, a large number of people had turned out in the Gram Panchayat elections held a few weeks ago.
In the months of January and February, many restrictions were further relaxed, local trains in Mumbai started.
Maharashtra currently has 61 per cent patients in the country
About eight to nine per cent of the total population of India lives in Maharashtra.
As on March 19, 2021, the number of active patients in the country is currently 2 lakh 68 thousand 692 people who have been affected by covid.
Considering the total number of patients, 1 crore 15 lakh 14 thousand 331 patients were registered in the country till March 19, 2021.
In particular, considering the testing statistics, a total of 23 crore 13 lakh 70 thousand 540 inspections were carried out in the country till March 19, out of which only seven per cent or 1 crore, 79 lakh, 56 thousand 830 inspections were done in Maharashtra.
Maharashtra ranks fourth in the world
Why this situation is so worrisome in Maharashtra will be seen in this table.
Considering the total number of covid patients by province, Maharashtra ranks fourth in the world.
Testing in Maharashtra increased again
As the number of covid patients has increased in the state, so has the number of check-ups.
On September 27 last year, 1 lakh 88 thousand people in the state underwent covid test.
But the test positivity rate has also increased, indicating how many of them were actually infected with the corona virus.
Across the country, the current test positivity rate is around five per cent, while in Maharashtra it is 14 to 15 per cent.
The higher the test positivity rate, the higher the risk.
Contact tracing is just as important as investigation to gain control over the disease.
The death toll rose, but the death toll remained low
In the last three months, the number of deaths due to covid in Maharashtra has also started rising again.
But the reassuring thing is that Covid's mortality rate is still low.
Between August and October, more than 200 to 300 deaths were reported daily in the state.
In percentage terms, the death toll has come down from 2.47 per cent in October to 0.44 per cent in the first fortnight of March.
State Chief Survey Officer Dr. Pradip Awate writes about it on Facebook, "Actually, there shouldn't be a single death, because drowning is so sad for the person in whose house it happens.
Is there adequate vaccination in Maharashtra?
Another plus side during the second wave of covid is that vaccines are now available on the corona virus.
Vaccination has also started in the state since January and vaccination is being carried out expeditiously.
But in order to control the epidemic, vaccination needs to be accelerated, experts say.
What about virus mutations, genome sequencing?
In Maharashtra, the second wave of Kovid's epidemic is spreading rapidly.
Such changes occur in viruses or in any cell.
By constantly sequencing the genome, it is possible to predict exactly what changes are taking place in the virus and how much more dangerous it has become.
But the rate of genome sequencing in India is still very low.

After entering the examination hall, spray sanitizer on your space.
Let the mask be on the face constantly.
Don't think too much of Covid once the paper starts.
Between the two papers ...
The exam consists of two papers and there is a break between the two papers.
Don't go outside the examination center.
No matter how much you want to discuss the question paper, it should be avoided.
After the exam is over

So don't be under the illusion that the exam is over.
In the end, it may or may not be cowardly even at the time of the main exam after this exam.
This will further help the government in planning the examinations at the time of the main examination.

Indifference among people is dangerous for everyone - Kishori Pednekar
Over the past few months, there has been a lot of speculation about the corona.
We know that there is a mini-lockdown in Pune.
Foreign workers from Mumbai went to the village
Foreign workers from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar in Mumbai have gathered at Lokmanya Tilak Terminus to return to the village.
Hearing that there will be another lockdown in Maharashtra, these workers have left for the village.

SSC-HSC board exams: Students say, 'You are endangering the lives of 30 lakh families'
You are endangering not only 30 lakh students but 30 lakh families.
Alternative examination methods could have been considered over the last year instead of written examinations.
Many such questions are being asked by the students of class X-XII.
We are not opposed to exams but should consider other options than going out for written exams.
Strict restrictions in the state and a complete lockdown on the weekends.
The 10th and 12th board exams will start in Maharashtra from the third week of April.
The 10th exam will be held from April 29 to May 21 and the 12th exam will be held from April 23 to May 20.
The government announced strict restrictions on Sunday (April 4) against the backdrop of rising corona patients in the state.
About 30 lakh students will appear for the board exams this year.
Anyway, why did the government decide to take the exams of nearly 30 lakh students at a time when the number of corona patients in the state is reaching a record high every day?
What is the government's plan so far for taking the exam?
The 10th and 12th board examinations will be held in April and May under the nine divisional boards of the State Board of Education (Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, Nagpur, Aurangabad, Kolhapur, Latur, Konkan, Amravati).
The state government has made it clear that the board's exams will be an exception to the newly imposed strict restrictions and the weekend lockdown.
In the background of these tests, it has been made mandatory for the academic staff to vaccinate the teachers and other staff or to bring with them a report that the Corona's RTPCR tested negative 48 hours before the test.
But how will the students reach the examination centers when there is a complete lockdown as many papers of the students come on Saturday?
Do students want to wear masks in a row for three to three and a half hours of exams?
Speaking to BBC Marathi, Varsha Gaikwad, Minister for School Education, said that if a student gets infected with corona during the examination, if any member of his family gets infected with corona or comes in contact with coronavirus, the concerned student will get a second chance to appear for the examination in June.
However, the education department has not yet announced the rules and regulations required for board students to appear for the exams in June.
As a relief to the students, the education department has extended the written test by half an hour.
If the exams are postponed, the next academic year may also be postponed.
What exactly are the objections of board students?
Some board students in Pune, Nashik, Nagpur and Mumbai in the state have expressed opposition to taking the written test.
These exams have also been excluded from the new restrictions of the government.
Speaking to BBC Marathi, Saloni Kamble, who is studying in 12th Science, said, "While the number of patients in Maharashtra is increasing tremendously, the board is pushing for written exams.
On the other hand, the students are also faced with the question of how to travel by public transport.
Sujata Angarkhe will also appear for the Class XII examination.
She adds, "On the other hand, the government is acknowledging that there is a strain on the health system.
How will we take the exam during the Corona period?
Speaking to BBC Marathi, Jeet said, "Our parents are worried about us.
Many students also feel that the state government could have considered several options throughout the year
We can be given homework or assignments, we can have open book exams, we can decide on the marks of class XI.
This exam is very important for 12th standard students.
What do teachers and experts think?
Just as there is confusion among the students, there is also an atmosphere of confusion and anxiety among the teachers.
Speaking to BBC Marathi, Bhausaheb Chaskar, a Zilla Parishad teacher and writer on educational issues, said, "The current situation has become very serious due to the massive contagion of Kovid.
Students have been learning through online learning throughout the year.
Speaking on the occasion, Bhausaheb Chaskar says, "Teachers have not been able to reach out to many students in rural areas due to lack of online learning facilities.
Our education system is exam-centric.
Given the place and special importance of the 10th-12th written examination in school education, there are no other options for the written examination.
How challenging can it be for the board to take the exam at such a time?
Speaking to BBC Marathi, Laxmikant Pandey, former president of the State Board of Education, Mumbai (Board), said:
Other options for taking the exam may also be considered.
He goes on to say, "Teachers will take proper care of Corona's background.
What did the school education minister say?
For the last several days, students of the board have been protesting against the written exams in various districts of the state like Pune, Nashik and Mumbai.
In an interview to BBC Marathi, Varsha Gaikwad said, "Students from districts where there is a complete lockdown will be considered.
He also clarified in this interview that he will not reconsider the decision of the 10th and 12th board examinations.
Failure to take board exams can lead to big questions for students in the future.
If students have corona during this period, a special examination will be held for them in June.
Students who are corona positive, have a corona positive at home, or live in a containment zone, or have a lockdown in their area, will have the opportunity to take the test in June.
But who is responsible if the students get corona?
It was demanded that the board exam should be conducted online instead of offline.
So we thought of all the kids rather than the online exam.
MPSC: 'Students are preparing by eating rice, under corona'
' Due to the new restrictions, the mess closes at 6 p.m.
There is a joint pre-examination on April 11 for the posts of PSI, Assistant Sales Tax Officer, Ministry Assistant.
But since the last week of March, the number of corona patients in the state, including Pune, has increased tremendously.
Students say they have symptoms and are not testing the corona.
The state of the meal on the one hand and the danger of the corona on the other
On the one hand, due to the restrictions imposed by the government, students are suffering from meals, on the other hand, many students are suffering from corona.
Students must be in good mental and physical health to take the exam.
Rasika Malmule, who lives with her friend in Narayan Peth, is currently preparing meals in the room.
Because the exams are often postponed, it is not possible to say when they will go ahead.
Why do students get corona infection?
Since many students live in the same room, if one gets infected with the corona, the other children get infected.
Speaking to BBC Marathi, Ajit Malve, who went to the village for fear of lockdown, said, "I have now left the village due to the previous lockdown.
I was living with friends in Pune.
Mahesh Gharbude, who is undergoing treatment at the Jumbo Covid Center in Pune, feels that the exam should be postponed.
He further said, "Students are demanding postponement of exams.
On the other hand, if the exams are not held, the students will stay together in Pune and the infection will increase again, says Nitin Mete.
Why is there a demand to postpone the MPSC exam?
The MPSC Coordinating Committee has demanded postponement of the examination to be held on April 1.
Speaking to BBC Marathi, Rahul Kavthekar, a member of the committee, said, "Many students do not take corona tests even though they are positive.
He added, "Students in Pune staged agitation last month.
What to take care of?
Health officials are also urging MPSC students not to shy away from testing for corona if they are exposed to it.
If students have symptoms, they need to have a corona test.
Corona vaccine: Will everyone above 25 years of age get corona vaccine as demanded by Uddhav Thackeray?
As the number of corona infections in Maharashtra and across the country is increasing rapidly, the government has started imposing restrictions as a last resort.
Vaccination has started in the country, but it is natural that it will take time for the vaccine to reach everyone in the 130 crore country.
From April 1, everyone over the age of 45 will be vaccinated across the country.
More than 82 lakh people have been vaccinated in Maharashtra so far and the campaign, which started on April 1, is vaccinating 3 to 4 lakh people daily across the state.
But the government says the condition is serious and the age limit should be reduced.
'Corona infection affects young people '
Uddhav Thackeray said in a press release after writing the letter, "Corona infection seems to be affecting a large number of young people and this age group also needs to be protected from the virus.
At the same time, the government is preparing to vaccinate people over the age of 45 more quickly within three weeks of a limited lockdown.
Uddhav had earlier in a meeting of the Prime Ministers demanded vaccination of persons above 45 years of age.
On the other hand, Raj Thackeray has also demanded that the age limit for vaccination be removed.
It is not just the government and political parties that are pushing for lowering the age limit for the corona vaccine.
Immunization is by far the only evidence-based measure to prevent infection.
Sir , inclusive of no scientific evidence that vaccination '
The Maharashtra government has suggested a comprehensive vaccination option, but the views of the central government and its experts do not appear to be conducive to these demands at present.
It will not be open to everyone at this time.
Speaking at a press conference at the Union Ministry of Health in Delhi on Tuesday, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said, Vaccination is not a priority for those who want it, but for those who need it more.
Many of these countries are still vaccinating only senior citizens and those with other ailments.
The Policy Commission, which works with the Ministry of Health on the country's cowardly policy, also has a negative view on lowering the age limit for vaccination.
Member of the Policy Commission, Dr. V. K. "We have to look at this demand from a scientific point of view.
Paul adds, "All we know is that vaccines reduce mortality and reduce inflammation.
Therefore, the focus is now on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's meeting with the Chief Ministers of all the states on Thursday regarding covid control.
"Second #rd highest wave of the 22 to 45 age group patients'
Although the central government is not yet ready to lower the age limit, many experts, especially in Maharashtra, are in favor.
The second wave we see in Maharashtra is most likely due to a new mutant, a mutated virus.
Secondly, we want to vaccinate 130 crore people.
Dr. of the All India Drug Action Network working in the field of health.
She goes on to say, "I am of the opinion that vaccination should be used judiciously and I am not saying that it should not be given to anyone.
At the same time, we are spending a lot of money on vaccinations.
Corona Lockdown: Will Uddhav Thackeray relax restrictions for traders and shopkeepers?
Another challenge facing the state government now is the growing opposition to sanctions in the face of increasing cases of corona infection in Maharashtra and the ongoing controversy between the central and state governments over vaccination.
Opposition parties, which initially co-operated with the sanctions, have now changed their stance.
Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday called a meeting of all traders and hotel operators' associations.
Sharad Pawar also suggested to follow the restrictions in his Facebook Live keeping in mind the reality.
'Decide till Thursday, otherwise we will open shop on Friday'
Today there are reports of agitations of traders and shopkeepers from many cities in the state.
FNCCI president Fatehchand Ranka had warned the state government in response.
There was a meeting of 57 different trade associations in our federation.
The administration has made a sudden announcement without any thought.
The agitation of traders is not happening only in Pune.
In Mumbai too, there is opposition to the manner in which many trade associations have imposed restrictions.
We urge the chief minister to allow all shops to remain open from Monday to Friday and to announce a strict lockdown on Saturdays and Sundays.
In fact, after a meeting with Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday, BC Bharatiya, national president of the Confederation of All India Traders, said in a statement that the traders had advised the government to keep the shops open at different times.
Instead of keeping everything closed, offices, shops, markets should be allowed to open at different times.
According to the trade representatives present at the meeting, Uddhav Thackeray has assured that the government will take a decision in two days.
'Don't use street language'
The state government is mired in increasing cases on the one hand and opposition to lockdowns on the other.
Let's think about what measures can be taken quietly without taking any risks.
Seeing the growing opposition of the business community to the restrictions, Sharad Pawar also had to fall into this issue.
Opposition from political parties
Before the limited lockdown in Maharashtra, Chief Minister Thackeray had spoken to the Leader of the Opposition.
Devendra Fadnavis has written a letter to the Chief Minister asking the government to reconsider these restrictions and take a decision.
This demand has been made not only by the opposition but also by the ministers in the government.
The central government has asked the Maharashtra government to take strict measures to prevent the infection.

Corona virus: Why is a night curfew imposed? What did he achieve?
Tell me one thing, Tai ... is the corona virus only the most active at night?
Rashi, who was returning home late at night from the office, asked me.
Besides Maharashtra, night curfew has been imposed in Delhi, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and some districts in Uttar Pradesh.
In Maharashtra, night curfew has been imposed from 8 pm to 7 am.
But what is the reason for doing so?
According to BBC Marathi correspondent Mayank Bhagwat, a large number of people go out at night for fun, go to nightclubs, eat in restaurants.
Number of patients in Mumbai
The Delhi government has also imposed a night curfew, but no reason has been given.
There are many doubts in the minds of ordinary citizens about this night curfew.
We asked 3 expert doctors what were the reasons behind the night curfew.
Dr. Sanjay Rai
First Opinion - AIIMS Professor of Community Medicine Dr. Sanjay Rai
Night curfew is not a very effective way to curb the spread of corona virus.
Corona virus is spread in 3 ways .
The second type of infection is caused by foamite.
The third type of infection is caused by aerosols.
Since most infections are spread by droplets or frostbite, it is advisable to use a mask, keep a distance of two feet and wash your hands around the world.
Dr. Shekhar C. Mande
Another expert - Dr. Director General of CSIR. Shekhar Mande
CSIR - Council of Scientific and Industrial Research is monitoring the ongoing research on this global corona.
Dr. Shekhar Manden said, "People are more likely to go to confined spaces and this is one of the reasons for the spread of corona.
People should not go to such confined places at night, which is the scientific reason for imposing night curfew.
When people don't listen, the government has to take steps to impose curfews at night.
Corona can be controlled by imposing night curfew, closing offices and restricting some financial transactions.
Doctor Jugal Kishor, Third Specialist - Dr. Jugal Kishor, Head, Department of Community Medicine, Safdarjung Hospital, Delhi
The imposition of a night curfew may be a small part of the government's larger strategy against the Corona.
The first thing is for people to stop going out for no reason, on their own.
State governments are using night curfews as a third option.
There is no research on how much night curfew alone reduces the risk of corona infection.
Information provided by the Central Government
Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan had sent a letter to the Maharashtra government on March 15, 2021.
It said the state government should pay attention to the containment strategy decided by the Union Health Ministry to stop the spread of corona.
Letter sent by Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan to the Government of Maharashtra on 15 March 2021
It is clear from this that the current night curfew is not being imposed on the instructions of the central government but on the instructions of the state governments.

The Covid Task Force is a committee of expert doctors.
Meanwhile, on Saturday (April 10), Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray held discussions with all party leaders.
If we want to stop the Corona disaster, we have to impose strict restrictions for a while.
What decision will Uddhav Thackeray take regarding implementation of lockdown in Maharashtra?
An important meeting was held today (April 11) to implement a complete lockdown in Maharashtra in the next few days.
The Covid Task Force is a committee of expert doctors.
On Saturday (April 10), Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray held discussions with all party leaders.
If we want to stop the Corona disaster, we have to impose strict restrictions for a while.
As per the information given by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on April 8,
As on March 1, 2021, 75,000 tests were being conducted every day in the state.
1.25 lakh RTPCR tests are being conducted daily.

From April 1 to April 7, the mortality rate is 0.55 per cent with 3 lakh 60 thousand 281 patients.
At present there are 5 lakh 1 thousand 559 active patients in the state.
4.32 percent of active patients are on oxygen while less than 1 percent of patients are on ventilators.
Based on all such information, how many days of lockdown is required to break the chain of corona virus infection?
Challenge in front of the government?
As the number of corona patients reaches its peak in the state, there was a consensus in the all-party meeting that the chain of infection will not be broken unless a complete lockdown is implemented.
In any case, the Uddhav Thackeray government may have to face the wrath of the business class, the working class and the employees.
The Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association (FRTWA) has demanded the announcement of a package for traders.
Union president Viren Shah said, "If the government is to announce a complete lockdown, it needs to clarify at today's meeting what package (financial assistance) it will provide to traders.
Furthermore, trade unions are opposed to allowing online sales.
Our goods worth crores of rupees are lying in the shops.
The government announced some rules for workers in the restrictions that have been in place since April 5.
Over the past year, the working class has also faced crises ranging from salary cuts to job losses.
Therefore, on the one hand, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray is facing the challenge of resolving the grievances of both the business class, which has been suffering losses for the past year, and the working class, which has been plagued by economic woes.
Decide to stop rail traffic?
In Mumbai, 95 per cent of the Western, Harbor and Central Railway services are currently operational and even ordinary passengers are allowed to travel at certain times.

It is the role of all to ensure that the poor, the working class and the underprivileged do not suffer while imposing strict restrictions.
The number of patients is increasing so fast that if we do not take a decision on lockdown today, a situation like lockdown will automatically arise tomorrow, said Uddhav Thackeray.

'... then people will take to the streets'
There should be restrictions.
However, the outbreak of the people should also be taken into consideration, said Devendra Fadnavis, Leader of the Opposition.
The sentiments of small business owners, retailers, hairdressers and other businesses need to be taken into account.
Fadnavis said some formulas need to be worked out as to which areas can run and with which options.

Corona: There are no ventilator beds in Pune and Nagpur.
The question arises as to whether the state's healthcare system is inadequate as corona infections continue to grow.
Recently, the state government had claimed that there was a shortage of vaccines.
Considering Pune, at present there is not a single bed with ventilator facility in Pune Municipal Corporation area.
A total of 543 ventilator beds were set up in Pune by government and private hospitals for the treatment of covid patients.
The situation in neighboring Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation is no different.
Similarly, there are only 43 ventilators left in Pune rural area at present.
This means that there is a shortage of ventilators in Pune compared to the number of patients and experts feel that the administration needs to address this.
Rising number of patients in Pune
On Friday (April 9), 58,993 new coronaviruses were found in Maharashtra.
At present there are 100051 (one lakh and fifty one) active corona patients in Pune.
In the Pune Municipal Corporation area, a total of 8598 beds have been provided in all the government and private hospitals for cowardly patients.
What causes this condition?
Patients hide their symptoms even after experiencing corona infection.
The responsibility of the Jumbo Covid Center in the Annasaheb Magar Stadium area of ​​Pimpri Chinchwad lies with Dr. Sangram owns Kapale's Medbrose Healthcare Company.
Dr. According to Kapale, the number of patients has been increasing rapidly in the last few days.
Dr. According to Sangram Kapale, about 52 deaths were reported in ten days at the Covid Center run by his company.
Former President of the Indian Medical Association, Dr. Avinash Bhondwe has also blamed the government for the situation.
Dr. According to Bhondwe, “This situation has arisen because the administration has not taken any lessons from the situation over the last year.
Both the state and the central government have neglected health issues in the past.
Social workers from Chakan, Dr. According to Vijay Gokule, both the administration and the citizens are responsible for this situation.
"Between October and January, there was a decline in the number of corona patients in the state.
This year’s Corona wave is even bigger than last year.
What is the solution?
We are trying to increase the number of ventilators at Pimpri Chinchwad Jumbo Covid Center.
Asked what are the options to prevent this situation of scarcity, he said, Currently, the number of critically ill patients is on the rise.
If patients are taken care of properly in this first stage, they will not have this time.
Patients are cared for at the Covid Center, he says.
There is a need to create a special mechanism for them.
Dr. Avinash Bhondwe also raised the same issue.
He says, "Monitoring of patients with home quarantine.
Similarly, in states where the prevalence of corona is not high, ventilators can be ordered immediately from those states.

He said, "Many messages from 10th and 12th class students are reaching us.
But some students say that postponing the exam is not a solution.
Saloni Kambli is studying in 12th Science in Mumbai.
The government should give another option to the written test and take the test so that the next admission process can be streamlined, says Saloni.
'Make the same decision for all students in the country'
To change the examination system of the board, the government will have to consider the examination system of other central boards as well.
Shiv Sena MP Arvind Sawant has demanded Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal to take equal decision for all board students in the country.

As Ashok Chavan, a senior minister in the government, raised this issue, its importance from the point of view of the government was also underlined.
Senior journalist Sandeep Pradhan has been working in the field of communication for more than a decade.
Over the last year, we have seen that no one has given any information, there has been a lot of talk and there has been a lot of confusion among the people.
Also, going further, Sandeep Pradhan also raised the issue of realistic information.
If people know how much medicine they have, how many beds they have, then there is both comfort and seriousness in people, says Sandeep Pradhan. 
If anyone in the government or in the ruling party starts giving information about a sudden lockdown, then there is a discrepancy.
Health: 'Lack of public awareness, it shouldn't be like that now'
Corona's crisis is basically a health crisis.
Health expert and Maharashtra President of Indian Medal Association, Dr. Talking to Avinash Bhondwe, we learned what mistakes we should avoid in the previous lockdown.
Dr. Avinash Bhondwe says, People don't just get corona.
Dr. Avinash Bhondwe goes on to say, "In the past, those with other ailments suffered a lot.
Dr. Avinash Bhondwe emphasizes on the issue of public awareness.
Also, "The government takes action against those who do not wear masks.
Dr. Avinash Bhondwe is always raising his voice for the rights of doctors.
After that, Dr. Bhondwe comments on the overall healthcare facilities.
He says, "Whenever there is a health crisis like Corona, it is impossible to do anything at the time.
We need to wake up now and start empowering our health system to fight diseases like corona.
In addition to communication, transportation is an important issue in the case of lockdown.
What exactly did the government do about transportation and avoid it from past experience, but this time after the announcement of lockdown and during lockdown, the issue of transport will not be the center of the problem?
Transport: 'Public transport should continue'
On April 11, the Mumbai Railway Police issued a statement.
The reason why this explanation is needed is well known.
BBC Marathi spoke to senior journalist and writer Rajendra Aklekar and reviewed the transport sector.
Rajendra Aklekar says, "Public transport should not be closed.
When there is a medical emergency, people will not rush if they are sure they can use the public transport system.
The closure of offices or other activities, of course, reduces the stress on the transport system and reduces congestion, says Akalekar.
Also, "Transport related to tourism should be stopped.
Rajendra Aklekar says, "All these things had caused confusion in the previous lockdown.
Meanwhile, Mumbai Mayor Kishori Pednekar told BBC Marathi, "Mumbai Local may decide to allow only essential service personnel as it did last year.
Education: 'We need to focus on educating children'
Schools have been completely closed for the past year or so.
On the one hand, on the other hand, a large section of students in Maharashtra are in rural areas, where the Internet is far, even access to electricity is a difficult thing.
Educationist Nilesh Nimkar says, "Schools are closed all year round because of the corona.
Keeping children connected to education is a big challenge.
Over the past year, some of the learning through technology has continued during the lockdown.
Nilesh Nimkar says, "Education through technology was limited to urban students.
Nilesh Nimkar draws attention to one more thing.
Nilesh Nimkar says that there is a task force for health and education should be implemented in the field of education which is as important as health.
During Corona and Lockdown, students are going through a different mental state.
Industry: 'Employment should not be affected'
All businesses came to a standstill after the lockdown was imposed last year.
Entrepreneur and economist Jayaraj Salgaonkar pointed out this issue.
Speaking to BBC Marathi, Jayaraj Salgaonkar explained his point in more detail.
He said, "Last time the lockdown was imposed and the workers went back to their hometowns.
There is a fear of migration after the lockdown.
Opposition in Maharashtra is demanding a certain amount of help from the working class.
Salgaonkar says that the employment cycle should not be broken as it was in the past.
The workers should look at the industry and the industry should look at the working class with sympathy, because the situation is serious.
We also talked to economists about what needs to be learned from previous lockdowns to keep the economy afloat.
Economy: 'People's purchasing power must be maintained'
Over the past year, it has been noticed that the lockdown has hit the economy.
Amit Modak, an economist, says, "The most important thing is that people should not run out of purchasing power.
Going further, Amit Modak says, "The government should not make misleading announcements.
If some efforts are made at the government level, the economy can recover.
If the responsibility of the workers is left to the owner of an industry, the owner himself is more afraid of being fired from the industry, he says.
Moreover, "the government should not be unstable about lockdown decisions.

Corona: 'Apart from owning a house, it has been difficult to meet household expenses since last year'
I was working for a jewelery company in Andheri MIDC.
Amit Hatankar is responsible for the entire family including parents, wife and five-year-old daughter.
Shubhangi Parab (name changed) from Thane, Mumbai, says, "We both work as husband and wife.
Over the past year, the budgets of the economically weaker sections as well as the working middle class families have collapsed.
Due to the curfew in the state, it has also hit businesses.
How to share household expenses?
There is not enough money for home loan installment, daughter's school fees, house maintenance, electricity bill, groceries.
Tried a lot for the job in the last two months but Corona says the job opportunities are extremely low in the health crisis.
Amit demanded that the government should also announce help for the working class.
This financial crisis has not only hit one person but hundreds of thousands of working men and women are facing it now.
Shubhangi Parab (name changed) says that the company's production was shut down for a few months in last year's lockdown.
Everything was fine again.
Debt weeks, house rent, house expenses are all stressful to buy.
Kaustubh Upadhyay from Mumbai has a tourism business.
He also suffered so much in the last year that he had to close his office in Dadar.

'A quarter of a crore Indians out of the middle class?'
According to a report by Business Standard , about 1.5 crore Indians have left the middle class due to financial difficulties caused by the corona virus outbreak.
The number of middle-class Indians, or those earning10 to 20 20 a day (Rs 750 to Rs 1,500) a day, would have dropped by about a quarter to three-and-a-half crore if the Corona crisis had not occurred, according to the Pew Research Center.
Citing the World Bank's economic growth forecast, the PEW Research Center said, "The recession in Covid-19 has further reduced the middle class in India."
What do economists say?
When the middle class economy collapses, it has a big impact on the markets and consequently on the government coffers.
For example, suppose a family buys a packet of biscuits.
Employment is generated from the purchasing power of the middle class.
Speaking to BBC Marathi, he said, "In a country like ours, 80 per cent of the unorganized working class suffers the most.
He adds, "All middle-class financial planning depends on salary growth.
It will take the lower middle class at least ten years to get the economic train back on track.
The reduction in spending by the middle class, as well as the non-purchase of consumer goods or luxury goods, will reduce economic activity, but will affect not only GDP but the entire way of life, says Dr. Welingkar, a professor of economics at the Institute of Management.
He says, "Maharashtra accounts for 13-14 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP).
The highest production in the state is from Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Nashik, Nagpur, Aurangabad districts.
The financial year 2022-23 will be very important for the country including Maharashtra, predicted Dr. Chandrahas Deshpande.
What can you do financially in the current situation?
Economist Abhay Tilak says that in today's exceptional and challenging situation, you can work on some basics or keep them in mind:
The current situation is not volatile but uncertain.
In such a situation, try to maintain the employment.
While working from home, do what you can to increase your employability while sitting at home.
Try to do only what is extremely mandatory.
Avoid taking any big risks when it comes to money.
Pandharpur-Mangalvedha elections: Political leaders dumb in 'watermelon-melon-champa' even during Corona
All over India, including Maharashtra, the second wave of corona is currently showing how critical the health system is.
Although the rules are not applicable in this Pandharpur constituency for the elections, all the rules of the fight against Corona are being trampled on due to the campaign.
What does the level of publicity indicate?
Maharashtra has been hit the hardest by the corona across the country.
Leaders and political activists are wondering why the cause of death of Bharat Bhalke, a local representative who died due to corona, has been forgotten in a few months.
Even in this situation, the leaders seem to be emphasizing each other's grievances and personal criticisms.
Looking at the campaign for this election, one may wonder exactly what issues political leaders value.
Jayant Patil had arrived in Pandharpur to fill the application of Bhagirath Bhalke (March 30)
Criticizing Chandrakant Patil, Ajit Pawar said , "Chandrakant Patil has never set up any institution, has not run any bank or factory, has not run any development society or labor society.

He said, "If there is a wedding near the campaign, only 50 people are allowed there.
Sanjay Pathak also expressed concern over the post-poll situation.
Campaign blasts but government neglect
On April 8 and 9, Ajit Pawar held large rallies in Pandharpur and Mangalvedha.

The coronary movement is hampered by the corona
Confusion in the medical field; Some medical colleges still refuse

Corona: 6 important things in Narendra Modi's speech
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has appealed to all states that lockdown should be the last resort.
He told the state governments of the country that lockdown should be considered as a last resort, as lockdown causes huge financial losses.
In his speech, Narendra Modi gave some suggestions to the six constituents.
1) 'Keep lockdown last option'
Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed all the states and advised them to keep lockdown as a last resort.
Modi said, "We are all working to save lives.
Also, I urge the state administrations to try to maintain the trust of the workers, tell them to stay where they are.
In today's situation, we want to save the country from lockdown.
2) 'Measures to increase oxygen supply launched'
Whether it is the Kejriwal government in Delhi or the Thackeray government in Maharashtra, they seem to be constantly talking about oxygen supply.
Measures are being taken at various levels to increase oxygen production and supply, Modi said.
3) Modi's assurance about speedy vaccination
Narendra Modi addressed the people about vaccination and tried to reassure them.
Modi said, "Yesterday we took a decision on vaccination.
Now, half of the vaccine that will be made in India will go directly to the states and hospitals, Modi said.
4) 'Youth, help the needy by forming committees'
Prime Minister Narendra Modi made an appeal to the youth of the country.
Modi said, "I especially urge my childhood friends to create an atmosphere in the house where people do not go out without work.
Young people, form small committees in your society, mohalla, apartment and help people to follow the rules of corona.
5) What did Modi say to the media?
Narendra Modi has also made an important appeal to the media.
Modi said, "The media is requested to warn the people.
6) 'You are laborers, stay there'
Narendra Modi has appealed to the workers of various cities to take note of the migration that took place during the Corona period last year.
The workers should stay in the same city as you are.
Also, "Vaccination will take place in the city where you are, and as a result, the work of their workers will not stop," Modi said.
Corona: Will there be enough vaccines available to vaccinate everyone over the age of 18?
The Government of India has announced its decision to vaccinate all persons above the age of 18 years.
On the one hand, when there is a shortage of vaccines in many states, including Maharashtra, the important question is whether there will be such a large number of vaccines available to everyone above the age of 18 years.
We will review the question of how it is possible that so many vaccines will be available.
What is the status of vaccination in Maharashtra so far?
According to the Government of India, 12 crore 71 lakh 29 thousand 113 people have been vaccinated across India till 7 am on April 20.
According to Maharashtra statistics, the first dose of Corona vaccine was given to 1 crore 9 lakh 59 thousand 587 people in the state till April 19, while the second dose of the vaccine was given to 13 lakh 14 thousand 386 people.
We have to keep in mind that this figure is from January 16, the beginning of vaccination in India.
Meanwhile, there was a shortage of vaccines and political allegations were leveled.
However, in reality, vaccination was stopped at many centers in Maharashtra.
So is it possible to vaccinate all people above 18 years of age in Maharashtra, and is it possible to supply so many vaccines to Maharashtra?
'This is possible with non-political planning'
Treasurer of the World Medical Association and former National President of the Indian Medical Association, Dr. Ravi Wankhedkar said, "Accelerating vaccination in Maharashtra is very important today because Maharashtra has become a hotspot in the country."
Speaking on whether we should be ready to vaccinate all people over the age of 18 from May 1, Dr. Ravi Wankhedkar said, "Such a large scale vaccination is easily possible if the central government and the state government stop politicizing the vaccine and if the administration moves without delay."
If the central government says it has announced this, then the central government should supply the same to Maharashtra or any other state.
He also said, "Even if 40 per cent people in Maharashtra are vaccinated, we will overcome 90 per cent corona."
Expressed by Wankhedkar.
What do the members of the Maharashtra government's task force think?
At the same time, BBC Marathi quoted a member of the Maharashtra government's Covid Task Force and Director of Critical Care at Fortis Hospital, Dr. Interacted with Rahul Pandit.
Dr. Rahul Pandit said, "The central government has taken a very important step.
I don't think we will face any problems as the central government has allowed vaccines to be taken directly from the manufacturers, he said, Rahul Pandit said.
However, "we have to plan well for this third phase of vaccination campaign, no doubt about it.
How will the vaccine be distributed?
Vaccine producers should give 50 per cent stock of the vaccine to the Center and 50 per cent to the state governments and the open market, the Center said.
Announcing the policy, the government said the stock could be given to the state governments and the open market at the price fixed by the producers.
Vaccine manufacturers will have to announce the price before May 1 to sell 50 per cent of the product to the state government and the open market.
After that, private hospitals will be allowed to decide how much to charge for the vaccine.
The 50 per cent vaccines that go to the central government will be distributed by the center to various states and union territories.
Those who take the first dose in the early stages of the campaign and take the second will be given priority during this vaccination.
Are there enough vaccines available?
In the first week of April, various vaccination centers across the state had to be closed due to depletion of vaccines in Maharashtra.
According to The Wire , 24 lakh doses of the vaccines produced in India, Kovishield and Kovacin, are produced daily.
Along with domestic demand, India is also committed to the Covax group.
But in the meantime, US restrictions on the export of raw materials for vaccines have affected vaccine production around the world.
Adar Poonawala of the Serum Institute had demanded this a few days ago by tweeting to US President Joe Biden.
We are all together in the fight against this virus, and that is why we are calling for the lifting of restrictions on raw material exports on behalf of vaccine manufacturers outside the United States, Poonawala said in the tweet.
Efforts are being made to bring other international vaccines to India along with the vaccines produced in the country.
When will the international vaccine arrive in India?
The Russian-made Sputnik-V vaccine has been approved by the Government of India for emergency use.
Dr. India. Sputnik has an agreement with Reddy's Laboratory for 10 crore doses of the vaccine. Russia had said it would hand over the Reddy's lab.
The vaccine will be available in India after May, said Dr. Vinod Paul had said.
There was talk of the government considering allowing vaccines approved by drug regulators in other countries after testing, but no other vaccines have been approved yet.
Johnson & Johnson has sought permission to conduct tests in India for the third phase of their Johnson single-dose vaccine.
Pfizer had applied to the Indian government for emergency recognition, but later withdrew.
There is still no clarity about the modern vaccine.
A central official told Reuters that the Indian government was ready to waive the 10 per cent import duty on international vaccines to make them available in India.

Little did we know that coronary heart disease would spread so rapidly.
We also told the doctor, don't follow Remedesivir.
People need to pay attention to oxygen measurement, fever, cold, cough.
Question 6 - on the doctor to the patient remadesivira B'Av is thrown?
Dr. Shashank Joshi- Patients put a lot of pressure on doctors.
Do not experiment with laboratory drugs on your patient.
Question 7 - Who should give Remedesivir?
Dr. Shashank Joshi: Various states have directed the Food and Drug Administration and doctors to dispense medicine.
Let the doctor decide which patient to take Remedacivir.
Question 8 - What came next in Remedesivir's test?
Dr. Shashank Joshi: The World Health Organization (WHO) had examined Remedesivir.
No research from around the world has shown that remedivir saves lives.
Question 9 - Will the wave of covid come again?
Dr. Shashank Joshi- People should be careful.
The second, third, fourth wave will continue to come.
The second wave is affecting young people and children.
Corona vaccine: Where do people over the age of 18 register to get the vaccine?
In view of the increasing prevalence of corona in India, vaccination of all persons above the age of 18 years will be started from May 1, 2021.
Today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a review meeting on Corona.
Vaccination for Covid 19 was started in India from January 16 and from March 1, citizens above 60 years of age and citizens above 45 years of age with congenital heart disease were being vaccinated.
Vaccines are also available at private hospitals depending on availability.
So let's see, what do people over the age of 18 have to do to get vaccinated, where do they have to register?
The Government of India has developed a digital platform called Co-WIN for the vaccination campaign.
What is the Co-WIN app?
Covin (Co-WIN) is a digital platform for the Covid 19 vaccination campaign.
The Covin (Co-WIN) app is available for download in the App Store.
How to register for vaccine?
Registration for vaccination is mandatory on Covin's website or from the Covin app.
After opening the website, scroll down and you will see the option 'Find Your Nearest Vaccination Center'.
Then the Register for Vaccination window appears.
You will then see the account details.
Users can give the date of vaccination only on this account details page.
You can then fill in the complete information for the vaccination center as well.
Clicking on the nearest center will tell you the time available.
You will see a registered message on the screen.
What are the 5 modules on the Covin app and what are they for?
The Covin (Co-WIN) app will have five modules - Management, Registration, Vaccination, Acknowledgment and Information.
People can register for vaccination through the registration module.
It will be an 'Administrator' module for vaccinating officers.
The information provided by the registrant can be verified by the vaccination module in the app and the status of the person can also be updated after vaccination.
QR code certificates will be generated through the 'Beneficiary Acknowledgment Module' for acknowledgment and an SMS will be sent to the person after vaccination.
With the help of 'Report' module, information on vaccination sessions - how many sessions were given, how many people were vaccinated and who did not come - can be reported to the authorities.
What documents are required for registration on Covin (Co-WIN) app?
You will need to have photo ID to register.
These documents can be used -
Voter ID card
Aadhaar card
Driving license
PAN card
MGNREGA employment card
Bank or post office passbook
Passbook
Pension documents
The same identity card used during registration has to be shown while going for vaccination.
How will the Covin app work?
This is a cloud based app designed for planning, implementation and monitoring of the vaccination campaign for Covid 19.
After registering through this app for vaccination, the registrant will be provided the date, time and details of the vaccination center via SMS.
Since each person will have to take two doses of the vaccine, the app will also tell you when you want to come back after taking the first dose and take the second dose.
After taking both doses of the vaccine, the person will be given a certificate in the form of a QR code.
Corona Maharashtra: Grocery stores in the state will be open from 7.00 am to 11.00 am
A meeting chaired by the Deputy Chief Minister also decided to limit the time of grocery shops from 7 am to 11 am as people are going out all day in the name of grocery shopping despite the restrictions.
Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar said that this decision had to be taken as many people in the state do not follow the rules of corona.
A meeting was held under the chairmanship of Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar in his ministry room to review the issues of enhancing health facilities in hospitals in the state, maintaining oxygen supply, overcoming the problems of doctors and health workers.
The meeting was attended by Health Minister Rajesh Tope, Urban Development Minister Eknath Shinde (via VC), Medical Education Minister Amit Deshmukh (via VC), Food and Drug Administration Minister Dr. Rajendra Shingane and other senior officers of the concerned departments were present.
Emphasis on oxygen generation projects
Given the growing number of corona patients and the growing demand for oxygen, oxygen generating plants should be set up in more and more hospitals immediately.
Paper, steel, petroleum, fertilizer companies, refinery industries should try to get more oxygen.
They should be traced and repaired immediately.
During the meeting, the Deputy Chief Minister reviewed the availability of beds, oxygen and remedicavir medicine in the hospitals in the state.
Oxygen-generating projects have been set up at hospitals in Kolhapur and Thane districts.
Mumbai Municipal Corporation has also started proceedings regarding such projects.
Demand to the Center for Remedesivir
Efforts are underway at the battle level to make remedesivir injection available in the state.
The meeting also expressed confidence that the state would soon have adequate stock of remedicivir.
Maharashtra Lockdown: Is the state moving towards a strict lockdown?
The administration is making strenuous efforts to stem the second wave of corona in the state.
For the last two months, there have been repeated warnings of lockdown in the state.
Accordingly, a curfew has been imposed in the state from 8 pm on April 14 to 7 am on May 1.
Essential services will be available from 7 am to 8 pm, rickshaws, trains, airlines and public transport.
You can read the entire manual here .
However, despite these restrictions, the situation in the state has not changed.
Even after the lockdown, there is still talk of congestion on the roads, increasing number of patients, lack of beds, medicines, lack of oxygen.
Against this backdrop, cabinet ministers are now warning of a lockdown again.
Considering all these things, the question has arisen as to whether Maharashtra is heading towards a severe lockdown.
' Lock in front, turn on '
One of the reasons behind the complete lockdown by the ruling political leaders as well as the authorities is the crowds on the streets.
Although Chief Minister Thackeray has imposed restrictions, the congestion on the roads does not seem to be decreasing.
People are leaving their homes for reasons like essential services, parcel meals, medicines, vegetables.
Whether the police and the administration are failing to stop the mob is also being debated on the other side.
Taking advantage of this, Gallogalli citizens can be seen standing in a crowd, sitting on benches.
Yogin Gurjar, a social activist and former president of the All India Consumer Consumers Federation, said that the reason behind this situation was the loophole given by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray.
According to Gurjar, "Lockdown in the state has become a joke at present.
Gurjar feels that citizens are equally responsible for this situation.
People do not avoid crowding.
... then a strict lockdown will have to be imposed - Ajit Pawar
Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Friday (April 16) warned that if the people do not cooperate, a tough lockdown will have to be taken as in the past.
Pawar was speaking at a corona status review meeting with the district administration in Pune.
Appealing to the citizens to cooperate with the administration and abide by the rules, Ajit Pawar said, "More people are being affected by the second wave of corona than the first wave.
Not only Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar but also other leaders in the cabinet were seen giving such hints.
Food and Civil Supplies Minister and Nashik Guardian Minister Chhagan Bhujbal has said that he is not insisting on strict restrictions but about complete lockdown.
Traders have demanded a complete lockdown in Nashik.
Mumbai Mayor Kishori Pednekar also demanded a complete lockdown.
Speaking to ANI, she said, "Most of the citizens seem to be following the lockdown.
Rising number of patients in Maharashtra
On the other hand, the number of corona patients in the state is not declining.
Over 60,000 coronavirus patients are being diagnosed every day in the state in the last few days.
At present there are 6 lakh 47 thousand 933 active corona patients in the state.
Not only this, it is also worth noting that there are 35 lakh 72 thousand 584 citizens who are in the home quarantine at present, who have come in contact with various patients and traveled, who are feeling the symptoms, who are not feeling them.
Lack of beds, medicines , oxygen , ventilators
On the one hand, complaints of non-availability of beds, medicines and oxygen have become commonplace as the number of patients has increased.
There are also complaints that the growing number of patients is putting a strain on health facilities.
On April 10, there was no ventilator left in Pune, Nagpur, Mumbai.
According to the latest information, there are only 9 ventilators left in Pune at present.
It is said that there is a huge shortage of oxygen in Nashik at present.
Against this backdrop, the number of beds should be increased as the number of patients is increasing in the state.
But this does not mean that the health system in the state has collapsed, explained Ajit Pawar.
He said, "The health system has been working harder than last year.
Meanwhile, the ruling party and the opposition have come face to face over the shortage of Remedesivir drugs, which has led to a tug-of-war.
Local restrictions began to be imposed, fueling essential services
Looking at all of the above, we can see that the Corona situation in the state is serious.
Disaster Management Minister Vijay Vadettiwar had also commented on the growing congestion on the roads.
Vadettivar had said that the state government had decided that fuel would be available only to the essential service personnel to stop the citizens from roaming on the roads without any reason.
In addition, some restrictions are being raised at the local level.
In addition, the travel time for essential services in Solapur has been reduced to just six weeks.
Citizens can only go to Solapur from 7 am to 1 pm to buy vegetables.
Considering all these developments, the restrictions in the state are likely to be even stricter.
Maharashtra Lockdown: What are the new government regulations for railways?
Under the state government's 'Break the Chain' initiative, new regulations have now been announced for rail travel.
Accordingly, those coming to Maharashtra from Kerala, Goa, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Delhi and Uttarakhand will have to show a negative report of the corona.
These six states have been declared corona sensitive.
The complete regulations issued by the Government of Maharashtra are as follows -
Passengers are required to wear a mask throughout the journey.
Passengers will be subjected to thermal testing while traveling at the train station.
It is important to follow the rules of social distance while getting in and out of the car.
Passengers are expected to arrive at the station early to avoid congestion for thermal scanning, as well as give passengers time to carry out all these procedures.
Train passengers are required to carry a mobile ticket or e-ticket so that they can be traced by mobile number.
RT-PCR testing of passengers coming from sensitive places is required.
It has been made mandatory to provide the information of the passengers coming to Maharashtra from sensitive places to the Disaster Management Authority of the district where the passengers are going.
No passenger coming from such a sensitive place can travel in Maharashtra without a reserved ticket.
Corona rules need to be announced at all railway stations.
After landing at the desired location, the passengers will be released after seeing the RT-PCR test report.
The home quarantine stamp will also be stamped on the hands of the passengers.
If positive test or thermal screening shows symptoms of corona, such passengers will be moved to Covid Center.
Many passengers may not have RT-PCR reports, in which case the railways should provide rapid antigen test facility, the rules said.

There are complaints that this drug is being black marketed.
Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis was the first to reach the Vile Parle police station after receiving information that Dokania had been arrested.
There was a verbal clash between the BJP leader and the police.
Action with political revenge:
We went to the police only after realizing that the Fadnavis police had arrested the owner of Brooke Pharma from his house.
The BJP leaders had approached the exporters in Daman and requested them to release the remaining stocks for Maharashtra due to the export ban.
Obtained the necessary legal permissions from the Food and Drug Administration of the Central and State Governments.

Police then carried out the operation at night.
Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis alleged that the action was taken out of revenge for political motives.
Why Fadnavis is so fond of: Nawab Malik
Why Rajesh Dokania of Brooke Pharma was summoned for questioning? T
He also asked why Fadnavis was so fond of this company.
Some companies have stocks available to us after banning the export of Remedesivir.
They are asking the state government to allow us to sell.
Rajesh Dokania, owner of Brooke Pharma, had personally met Food and Drugs Minister Rajendra Shingane along with Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Council Praveen Darekar.
The export companies have stocks of drugs, on the basis of which information was being gathered by calling Dokania.
Rajesh Dokania has been questioned and released.
You tweet and say that we are going to get a stock of 50,000 remedivir injections.
But when the government asks, these professionals do not give.
So what is the politics behind this? The BJP should make this clear, Malik said.

Corona: Are hospitals in Maharashtra becoming a death trap?
A fire at Vijay Vallabh Hospital in Virar killed 13 covid patients. 
While struggling to survive in the ICU, these patients were attacked by time.
This is not the first case of Kovid-19 or general hospital fire in Maharashtra.
More than 45 patients have lost their lives in hospital fires in the past few months.
An inquiry is ordered by the government following the hospital fire. 
Action is taken after the inquiry report.
But concrete measures do not seem to be happening.
So hospitals in Maharashtra are becoming a death trap? This important question reappears.
Incidents of hospital fires
April 23, 2021 - Thirteen patients die in a fire at Vijay Vallabh Hospital in Virar. 
The primary cause of the fire was said to be an explosion caused by a short circuit in the AC unit.
April 10, 2021 - A fire broke out at Covid Hospital in Wadi area of ​​Nagpur. 
4 patients died. 
A fire broke out in the AC unit in the ICU.
March 26, 2021 - A fire at Sunrise Covid Hospital in Bhandup kills 11 Covid patients. 
The primary cause of the fire was a short circuit.
October 2020 - Apex Covid Hospital in Mulund catches fire. 
1 patient died. 
It was reported that the fire started due to excessive heat on the generator.
January 2021 - A fire broke out in the neonatal ward of Bhandara District Hospital.
It killed 10 newborns.
The investigation revealed that the radiant spark in the radial thermal control panel had started.
What caused the fire in the hospital?
The main reasons for the firefight are negligence of the hospital administration, delay in checking the fire safety in the hospital by the government agencies.
Pratap Karguppikar, former Chief of Mumbai Fire Brigade, explains the main reasons for the fire in the hospital -
Fire retardant material is not used in the Covid Center or in the hospital
The air in the AC room should be completely changed at least 20 times per hour. I
f there is too much oxygen in the room, there is a possibility of fire
Covid uses sanitizers to wash hands in the hospital. 
The flammable gas in it stays in the air.
If the AC is kept on continuously, the part in it is likely to overheat and explode.
If the wiring is defective, there is a risk of fire.
All these things are not taken care of in the name of emergency management.
Maintenance and repair are neglected. 
The combination of oxygen and flammable substances is very dangerous," added Pratap Karguppikar.
Prashant Thackeray, who lives in Palghar, has installed AC system in many hospitals. 
He says, "The AC needs to be maintained and repaired in a timely manner.
If the wiring, cabling breaks down, there is a possibility of a short circuit."
Can an AC explode?
The primary cause of the fire in the hospital in the last few days is the explosion in the AC unit.
Talking about it, Pratap Karguppikar says, "The AC machine needs to rest after eight hours.
It actually needs two machines. 
If the AC is on continuously, it will get very hot.
The part in the AC will get hot. 
There is a possibility of a small explosion."
BJP leader Kirit Somaiya said, "No hospital in the state has undergone fire safety audit. 
This audit needs to be done in a scientific manner.
Bhandup hospital did not have fire safety.
The government should audit all covid centers."

The National Disaster Management Authority has issued fire safety instructions to hospitals across the country in 2016 -
The hospital wall and floor should be fireproof
In case of fire, automatic fire protection system should be activated
Fire alarm system, fire extinguishing system
There should be a duct or shaft to secure the electrical wiring
The hospital should practice once a year how to get patients out of the ICU and ward in an emergency
Study of ICU management in case of emergency
AC inspection panels and doors should be fireproof.
Many guidelines like these have been given regarding the fire safety of the hospital.
The main reason for negligence?
Paper horses are danced by the government after a hospital fire incident.
After preparing the report, action was taken against two or four people. 
But no concrete measures are being taken.
It is the job of Wireman and the engineers to check whether there is a fire audit in the hospital, whether the fire protection equipment is proper, whether there is a short circuit.
They should be monitored by senior officers, but this is ignored," says Mahesh Jhagde, a former chartered accountant.
What is the situation in Mumbai?
After the hospital fire, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had ordered fire audits of all hospitals in the state.
The issue of lack of fire safety in the hospital was raised in the March budget session. 
Urban Development Minister Eknath Shinde had admitted in the legislature that fire safety flaws were found in 701 hospitals in Mumbai.
State Government Information -
Mumbai Municipal Corporation conducted fire safety audit of 1324 private and government hospitals
663 Errors in fire safety measures in private hospitals. 
Notices were issued to these hospitals
Errors were found in 38 government and municipal hospitals
A fire audit of Thane hospitals was conducted on the background of the accident at Bhandara District Hospital. 
The fire department inspected 347 hospitals in Thane.
Notices have been sent to 168 hospitals in the city.
According to information provided by the government to the legislature, faulty electrical systems are the main cause of fires in most cases.
In April 2019, the Bombay High Court had ordered the sealing of all hospitals in Mumbai and Thane which were not allowed by the fire department.
Mumbai Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal had in April ordered a fire safety audit of all hospitals.
Faulty wiring is the leading cause of fire
In 2018, the then Minister of State for Urban Development Ranjit Patil had informed the Legislative Council that 69 per cent of fires in Mumbai were due to faulty wiring.
Between 2008 and 2018, there were more than 49,000 fires in Mumbai. 
In more than 33,000 cases, the government said fires were caused by short circuits.
Corona Virus: What is Proning? Why did the Ministry of Health advise 'this' to coronaries?
In the second wave of corona, the situation is getting worse day by day. 
A large number of Kovid-19 patients need oxygen. 
But severe oxygen shortages across the country have claimed the lives of many patients.
Many hospitals in the country had said that they had only a few hours of oxygen left.
Delhi's Max Hospital had to go to court for oxygen supply.
The Union Ministry of Health has come up with some simple methods of pronation for patients who have difficulty breathing. 
This is called 'Pronation for Self Care' by the Ministry of Health.
Pronying can help patients with covid-19 to improve their oxygen levels
What is 'Proning'?
Proning is the process of taking a deep breath while lying on your stomach properly.
This helps to compensate for the lack of oxygen in the body, according to guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
The guidelines say it is very beneficial for covid patients who are in isolation at home and have difficulty breathing or have low oxygen levels.
These methods should be used if the patient is having difficulty breathing or if the oxygen level in his body is less than 94, the instructions said.
While in home isolation, oxygen level, blood pressure, blood sugar level and body temperature should be constantly monitored.
Properly covered, it will withstand a great deal of adverse conditions.
This method, which improves respiratory function and oxygen levels, has been medically approved.
This condition is completely safe and can be controlled by lowering the level of oxygen in the blood.
Good results have also been seen in patients admitted to the ICU.
This procedure can be effective if you do not have a ventilator.
Emphasis on sleeping on the stomach
It is recommended to sleep on the stomach during pronation. 
It has been suggested to use a pillow for this. 
One pillow under the neck, one or two pillows should be taken from the chest to the thighs and two more pillows should be placed on the feet.
A total of 4-5 pillows will thus be needed to sleep on the stomach.
And the person can decide how thick the pillow should be.
It also tells you how to change your position every now and then
Do not stay in the same position for more than 30 minutes and keep changing your position.
When should Proning be done?
Proning should not be done if the patient is pregnant or if the patient has a heart condition.
Also, everyone should sleep in this way as long as they can sleep comfortably.
Do not sleep on your stomach immediately after eating.
During a 24 hour period you can do proning in different positions for 16 hours.
If you feel pain after sleeping in the same way, reduce the stress on that part of the body and sleep in a way that makes you feel better.
Corona Maharashtra: Can it be said that the situation in Mumbai-Pune has improved?
In the second wave of corona, the number of patients in Maharashtra started increasing rapidly. 
It showed cities like Mumbai-Pune setting new records in the number of patients every day.
This became clear from the daily statistics of the state government.
However, the statistics of these cities over the last few days have given a promising picture.
Since April 19, the number of patients recovering in Mumbai-Pune has been increasing compared to the new corona patients.
However, the question arises as to what is the reason behind this and if so, would it be fair to say that the situation in these cities has really improved.
To find the answer to this question, let's first look at the statistics of corona patients in these two cities.
What do the numbers say?
According to the statistics of Mumbai and Pune, since April 19, the number of patients recovering in these cities has increased as compared to the number of new patients.
As many as 7,381 new corona patients were found in the city on April 19 and 8,583 patients were cured, according to Mumbai Municipal Corporation data.
On April 22, 7,410 new patients were found in Mumbai, while the number of cured was 8,090.
This means that the number of patients recovering in Mumbai has increased compared to the number of new patients.
According to the Pune Municipal Corporation, 4,587 new corona patients were found in Pune on April 19, while 6,473 patients were cured.
On April 22, 4,539 new patients were found in Pune, while 4,851 patients were cured.
This means that the number of cured patients is also increasing in Pune city.
The number of infected patients is stable
The number of patients being infected daily in Mumbai had gone up to 10,000 in the medium term, while in Pune it was over 6,000. 
Now the situation is changing and the number of new patients is steadily increasing.
State Health Survey Officer Dr. Speaking on the occasion, Pradip Awate said, "Currently, the number of infected patients is stable.
About 80 to 85 percent of the 100 victims have mild symptoms. 
Many people get it at home. 
Therefore, the rate of recovery is increasing rapidly and the severity of the infection is mild.
Former state president of the Indian Medical Association, Dr. According to Avinash Bhondwe, "If the number of new patients continues to rise next week, the situation is under control.
"Currently, the growing number of patients is slowly stabilizing. 
Only after we see where this graph is heading in the next three weeks can we determine whether the infection is being controlled," he says.
Do restrictions reduce morbidity?
The Maharashtra government has announced a lockdown in the state to prevent corona. 
This has led to strict restrictions in the state at present.
Asked whether the state government's restrictions were reducing the number of patients, Bhondwe said, "The new government is benefiting from the restrictions imposed from April 14 onwards.
The reduction in congestion in the streets and markets has definitely reduced the incidence of infection.
In order to reduce the number of new coronaviruses and increase the number of recoveries, these restrictions should be continued for another fortnight.
So, in the first 15 days of this wave of corona, the number of healings is low, then the number of healings gradually increases. 
This cycle continues later.
It cannot be said that the effect of the current restrictions is seen in the number of people who are recovering, "said Awate.
It will take another three to four weeks for the growing number of corona patients to come under control.
When people get beds and oxygen easily, it can be said that the infection is under control, '' Awate thinks.
Corona virus: Did corona grow due to election campaigns in India? - Reality check
The number of corona virus infections in India is increasing rapidly.
The growing number of patients is putting a huge strain on the country's healthcare system.
Meanwhile, elections are underway in four Indian states. 
Therefore, the reason behind this situation in India is being pointed out to the election campaign rallies.
But the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party has denied the allegations.
There is no connection between the growing number of patients in the country and election campaigns or religious programs, explained BJP leader Dr. Vijay Chauthaiwale has given.
The number of patients has increased since February
The number of corona virus cases in India has been declining since mid-September 2020. 
But by the end of February, the numbers had picked up again.
The morbidity graph for the month of March is growing at a tremendous pace. 
As a result, numbers in the second wave appear to be growing twice as fast as in the first wave of the corona. 
 The previous high of corona patients was also broken this time.
Meanwhile, elections are being held in the four Union Territories of West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam and Puducherry in India. 
Campaign rallies of political parties have been taking place here since the beginning of March. 
Voting will take place in March and April.
Did Corona grow because of the campaign?
Even during the Corona period, large crowds were seen at the rallies of political parties.
In the meanwhile, the social distance was completely blown away.
Besides, there were no masks on people's faces.
None of the leaders, candidates or their supporters were seen following the Corona restraint rules.
Meanwhile, the Election Commission of India has sent a notice to West Bengal in this regard. 
The commission has banned campaign rallies in West Bengal since April 22 due to non-compliance by political leaders.
On the other hand, the number of patients in West Bengal has been increasing rapidly since March.
You can see the rising graph of the number of patients.
The situation is similar in other states with more or less differences.
However, the exact number of corona outbreaks could not be ascertained.
But it is not only in these four states that the number of patients is increasing.
The period also saw a rapid increase in the number of corona patients in other states in the country.
Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka are experiencing rapid growth of corona. 
 There are no elections in these states.
However, the number of patients here is high.
Therefore, it cannot be said directly that elections alone increase corona.
We don't even have concrete evidence to say so.
High risk in confined spaces
Experts say that the risk of infection is lower when people gather in the open than in a closed place.
Warwick Medical School Pvt. According to Lawrence Young, the virus can become inactive rapidly in the open.
However, the risk of infection is higher if such a large crowd gathers in one place. 
People stand close to each other in crowded places for a long time, they do not observe social distance, at such times the infection can spread, said Prof. Young said.
University of Bristol's Pvt. Jonathan Reid says, "There is a risk of standing nearby. 
Especially if someone is standing in front of or around you at a distance of 1 meter, the risk of infection is higher.
If a person shouts loudly in such a situation, the chances of infection are also higher through the snow that comes out of the mouth.
The reason for the increase is the new variant?
Scientists are studying whether there is another variant of corona after the second wave of corona in India.
According to experts, even if there is such a possibility, there is no strong evidence for it.
Due to lack of proper statistics, the Indian Department of Public Health has not yet included the Indian variant of the Corona in its 'Variant of Concern' list. 
The term is used in the UK for variants of Brazil and South Africa.
Apart from that, Kumbh Mela was also organized in North India in the month of March. 
 Millions of devotees from all over the country gather here . 
Here, too, it is said, corona prevention rules have not been properly followed.
Between April 10 and 14, more than 1,600 coronary artery disease cases were detected during the Kumbh Mela.
Corona virus: 20 patients die due to lack of oxygen, oxygen tanker admitted
Oxygen deficiency has claimed the lives of 20 patients at the Jaipur Golden Hospital in Delhi.
The Jaipur Golden Hospital in Rohini area of ​​Delhi had said in the morning that it had only half an hour's supply of oxygen left.
The oxygen tanker was admitted to the hospital at 12.30 pm.
The hospital has 200 patients, 80 of whom are on oxygen support and 35 in the ICU.
Last night, 20 critically ill patients died due to lack of oxygen, PTI reported.
We are waiting for the oxygen supply and 215 patients of Kovid 19 are in dire need of it," said the hospital's medical director.
Most of the 20 people who died were Kovid-19 patients and were admitted to the hospital's critical care unit, the Hindustan Times quoted hospital officials as saying.
As the hospital ran out of oxygen, the oxygen pressure dropped and all these patients died.
The hospital's medical director, Deep Baluja, said, "We lost all the patients who were being supplied with high pressure oxygen in the critical care unit.
We ran out of liquid oxygen by 10 pm on Friday.
According to the Hindustan Times, the hospital was supposed to receive oxygen for them by 5.30 pm on Friday, but the stock did not reach the hospital by midnight.
Even after the death of 20 patients, the hospital has received only 40 per cent of the oxygen it needs.
Dr. "We are facing a crisis once again.
200 lives are in danger. 
 We saved a lot of lives last night but we may not be able to do that today.
The oxygen we kept as backup is now gone," Baluja said.
Give oxygen to Delhi, Kejriwal's letter to all Chief Ministers
Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has written a letter to all Indian chief ministers demanding oxygen.
Kejriwal gave this information through a tweet.
The central government is helping us, said Arvind Kejriwal.
There are reports of oxygen shortages in many hospitals in Delhi. 
In such a situation, Kejriwal has made this demand.
It will be important to see which state responds to this letter.
Corona virus: AIIMS and ICMR's new guidelines for treatment of Kovid 19 elderly patients
AIIMS, ICMR, Covid 19 Task Force and Joint Monitoring Group have announced new procedures for the treatment of Covid 19 elderly patients.
These patients are categorized as Mild, Moderate and Severe and are given instructions on how to treat these patients.
New guidelines from AIIMS and ICMR
Elderly patients infected with the corona virus who do not have difficulty breathing will be considered a mild infection type.
Senior patients whose body oxygen level is between 90 and 93 percent while in the room will be considered in the moderate to moderate infection category.
Patients whose body oxygen level is less than 90 percent when they are in the room will be considered to have a serious infection.
Patients with a mild infection are advised to stay in home isolation, observe social distance, and consult a doctor.
Patients with moderate infection are advised to be admitted to the ward where oxygen is available. 
If the patient is in critical condition, CT scan and X-ray of the chest are recommended.
Patients with severe infections are advised to be admitted to the ICU. 
Respiratory support should be given according to their condition.
Patients of moderate and severe type should be discharged from the hospital as per the criteria for discharge after their health improves.
People over the age of 60, with heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, bladder, lung or liver disorders, have a higher risk of contracting the corona virus. 
Mortality has also been found to be higher in such patients.
The guidelines state that remedesivir should be used only for moderate to severe patients who do not need oxygen support.
Remedacivir, which is in home isolation and does not require oxygen, should not be given.
Tosilizumab is recommended for critically ill patients who have been admitted to the ICU for 24 to 48 hours and whose condition is deteriorating.
Corona: 'Oxygen Express' arrives in Nashik
After unloading 3 tankers at Nagpur on Friday night, Oxygen Express has now reached Nashik.
Due to lack of oxygen in Maharashtra, it is planned to supply from abroad.
Railways have started supplying oxygen to the state and the train that went to fetch oxygen has returned to Maharashtra.
Three oxygen containers brought from Visakhapatnam were unloaded from Roll on Roll of (Roro) Oxygen Express at Nagpur on Friday (April 23) night.
After that this morning Oxygen Express has arrived in Nashik.
The first train of Roro Oxygen Express was sent from Kalamboli station in Mumbai.
The train went to Visakhapatnam with empty containers, which were filled with oxygen.
The train left Visakhapatnam on Thursday night.
7 oxygen tankers were placed on this train. 
Out of which 3 tankers have landed in Nagpur.
Railway officials had informed about this initiative while the train was leaving. 
Accordingly, 16 metric tons of oxygen will be brought from each compartment of this special train of seven coaches and this train will be given priority over the railways. 
The Railway Ministry plans to launch other such trains.
The 12 states in India that are experiencing shortage of oxygen for medical use are Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan.
On the one hand, there are states like Madhya Pradesh which do not have enough capacity to meet the demand for oxygen for medical use, while on the other hand, there is a growing demand for oxygen from the oxygen producing states of Gujarat, Karnataka and Rajasthan.

Corona Maharashtra: Color coding rule for vehicles in Mumbai repealed - Mumbai Police
Mumbai Police has withdrawn the decision of color coding for classification of vehicles traveling during lockdown in Mumbai.
During the lockdown, the Mumbai Police had asked to reduce the number of vehicles on the road and to affix red, green or yellow stickers on the vehicles in an attempt to classify them.
 Its implementation was also initiated.
But now this color classification has been discontinued.
However, Mumbai Police said that they will continue checking the vehicles.
Mumbai Police had started color coding to reduce the number of vehicles on the roads during the lockdown.
Red color for vehicles of medical staff, medical services
Green for vegetables, groceries, fruits and dairy carts
Yellow for essential service
The 6-inch round sticker was affixed to the front and rear windows of the vehicle.
The stickers were obtained from the police at some toll plazas and blockades.
The order was issued by Mumbai Police Commissioner Hemant Nagarale himself.
Doctors, ambulances and medical vehicles are getting stuck due to checkpoints at the toll plazas.
A color code policy is being introduced for this.
Emergency service people will have to affix stickers on the vehicles," Hemant Nagarale had said.
Police, corporations, journalists, doctors, some are taking advantage by putting up posters like this.
Therefore, the Mumbai Police is investigating whether the employees in the vehicles are working for essential services.
"We want to carry out the lockdown announced by the Maharashtra government in a good way," Hemant Nagarale had said.
On the other hand, Mumbai's Guardian Minister Aslam Sheikh said, "The vegetable market is not overcrowded.

Corona: What is a '6 minute walk test' to check lung health?
As the incidence of corona infection is increasing day by day in Maharashtra, the '6 minute walk test' is currently being discussed everywhere. 
We will learn about this.
Covid-19 is spreading like a tsunami across the country.
With more than 3 lakh patients found in a single day, haha: cars have been blown up across the country. 
The second wave of corona infections is affecting family-to-family. 
In everyone's mind, I was afraid that I would get a corona infection, or it would have happened.
If someone coughs or sneezes on the side, we immediately look at that person with suspicion. 
Trying to get away from that person. 
Many feel like I'm out of breath. 
No cough, but feeling restless.
There is a constant fear in my mind, I have not had a corona infection?
Has this ever happened to you? 
According to doctors, '6 minute walk test' is the simple answer to all your questions.
What is a 6 minute walk test?
The coronavirus attacks the lungs. 
Which obstructs breathing. 
Covid-19 infection reduces lung function, experts say.
According to the Maharashtra Health Department, "During the Covid-19 period, the simplest and easiest way to check whether the lungs are in good health or function is a '6 minute walk test' or a '6 minute walk test'."
The director of the intensive care unit of Fortis Hospital, Dr. Says Rahul Pandit, "The 6-minute walk test was developed to find out the tolerance of the heart and lungs after exercise.
The Maharashtra Health Department has issued a circular to inform the people about the 6 minute walk test.
According to the health department, '6 minute walk test' helps to know the hidden hypoxia in the blood.
o that the needy patients can be admitted to the hospital on time.
What is Happy Hypoxia?
According to experts, even if the oxygen level in the patient's body decreases, the patient looks normal.
he patient shows no signs of obstruction in breathing. 
In medical parlance this is called 'Happy Hypoxia'.
How to do 6 minute walk test?
According to the health department -
Before taking a 6 minute walk test, check the level of oxygen in the body with a Pulse Oximeter.
Then walk around the house with a clock or stopwatch for six minutes
Do not walk too fast or too slow.
After walking for six minutes, check the oxygen level in the blood again
Head of Physiotherapy Department of Nanavati Max Super Specialty Hospital, Dr. Ali Irani says, "Some people may get short of breath while doing this test. 
 Or stop if they need to. 
But, keep the clock on for six minutes. 
Once the shortness of breath is cured, you can start the test again.
You can also run with the help of a stick or a walker."
What to do after walk test?
According to experts, blood oxygen levels should be measured again after a home walk test.
The oxygen level should be compared before and after the test.
So that the difference in oxygen level is known.
"Blood pressure, oxygen levels and heart rate should be measured immediately after the test, one minute and five minutes apart.
It is important to note this to understand how long your recovery period is," he said. 
Irani goes on to say.
Who should do '6 minute walk test'?
According to a statement issued by the health department, people with fever, cold, cough or other symptoms of corona infection, as well as those in home isolation, should take a 6-minute walk test.
Dr. Ali Irani added, "Anyone can do this test.
There is no age limit.
This test can be done for yourself or for a family member."
While Dr. According to Pandit, "this test should be done within 5 to 12 days after the onset of symptoms."
Can patients with covidosis do this test?
Dr. "Patients with corona can take the test.
They are afraid of getting oxygen.
If they take the test, they will know the level of oxygen in the body and will be able to go to the hospital on time if needed," says Irani.
Doctors perform these tests while discharging coronary artery patients in the hospital.
What should senior citizens over 60 do?
According to the health department -
Senior citizens above the age of 60 should walk for 3 minutes instead of 6 minutes.
It is better to have someone with you during the test. 
Senior citizens can take the test by walking for 3 minutes instead of 6 minutes, said Dr. Pandit also says.
What does the result of this test say?
Exercise changes heart rate and oxygen levels. 
This can help determine if the body's oxygen levels are low.
According to the health department -
If the oxygen level in the blood does not decrease after walking for six minutes, then you are in good health
If the oxygen level drops by 1-2 percent, there is no reason to worry.
Test twice a day to see if there is any change
To explain what the figures before and after the test say, Dr. Iranians give examples.
"The oxygen level before the test will be 97 and then 95. 
So, don't worry.
A 2-3 percent difference after the test is normal.
But, if you see too much difference in the oxygen level, that's a concern."
When to seek immediate advice?
According to the state health department -
After six minutes of walking, the oxygen level dropped to less than 93
Shortness of breath
Oxygen levels dropped by more than three percent
In case of any of the above, seek immediate medical advice.
Dr. Irani says, "This means that not as much oxygen is needed in the lungs.
So there is a difference in the level of oxygen."
If the oxygen in the body is more than 94 after this test, then there is no need to rush to the hospital.
 You can consult a doctor by informing him about this test over the phone," he said. 
Says Rahul Pandit.
Where can I do this test?
According to the health department -
This test should be done on any hard surface or ground
There should be no ups and downs on the ground where you are going to walk
Do not perform this test on the steps
Walk on the ground in the house
Test where there is maximum free space
What does this test cost?
Dr. Rahul Pandit says, "Doctors, nurses or paramedical staff do not need to be present to perform this test.
Anyone in the family can do this test using a finger pulse oximeter."
All you need is a pulse oximeter, a watch, a stopwatch or your mobile phone.

There were a total of 17 patients in the ICU, 13 of whom have died.
Dr. Vijay Vallabh Covid Care Hospital Officer."
21 patients were shifted to another hospital, including some critically ill patients," Dilip Shah told ANI.
The fire broke out on the second floor of this four-story hospital.
Police officials at the scene told the media, "The AC in the ICU exploded and caught fire at around 3.30 pm. 
At that time, there were 17 patients in the ICU. 
Four patients and staff came out, but the rest could not survive the fire.
There are 80 non-covid patients who are safe. 
The 4 patients who survived the ICU have been shifted to another place.
The dead included 5 women and 8 men.
Pakistan stands firm with India in cowardly crisis - Imran Khan
India is facing this dangerous wave of corona virus. 
Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan has said that Pakistan stands firm with India in this crisis.
Imran Khan tweeted, "India is facing this dangerous wave of Corona virus. 
 I am with Indian citizens in this time of crisis. 
Our neighbors and the whole world are fighting against Corona virus. 
I pray that they recover as soon as possible. 
Let's face the global crisis together and with humanity. "
After Imran Khan tweeted this, Indian Twitter users are seen thanking him.
For the past few days, the general public has been talking about the Corona crisis in India on Pakistan's social media.
#PakistanstandswithIndia is also trending on Twitter in India.
The corona crisis in India is getting darker day by day.
Over the last few days, more than 3 lakh coronavirus patients are being diagnosed in India every day.
The corona situation in India is being discussed on media and social media around the world. 
here is a lot of talk about the lack of oxygen and beds.
Neighboring Pakistan is also discussing the Corona situation in India.
Hashtags like #WeCantBreathe, #IndiaNeedsOxygen and #IndianLivesMatter were trending on Twitter in Pakistan on Friday (April 23).
More than 28,000 tweets have been made so far using the hashtag #IndiaNeedsOxygen.
 Also, the number of tweets using the hashtag #WeCantBreathe is over 54,000.
Despite political tensions between the two countries, it is a matter of special concern for Pakistani citizens to seek India's help.
' Im Ran Khan to help the '
Journalist Wajahat Kazmi tweeted using the hashtag #Indianeedsoxygen.
The situation in India is worrying. 
Everyone from Kovid should be healed, pray for India, he said.
Pakhtun social activist Usama Khilji called on Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan to help India.
"On behalf of thousands of Pakistanis, I urge the government to help India with its oxygen. 
It is gratifying to see the hashtags #IndiaNeedsOxygen and #IndianLivesMatter trending in Pakistan.
De Kamal said, "Pakistan is expected to forget its internal differences and supply India with what it needs.
The photos and news there are frightening.
Humanity comes first."
Also, India is a neighbor, not an enemy, tweeted Salman Haider.
Preaching to both countries
Ammar Hashmi's Twitter account provided a dose of advice to both countries. 
Using the hashtag #WeCantBreathe, he wrote, "The situation would have been different if the two countries had focused on health care rather than spending money on the military."
Usman Mehboob says, "We have to help India by putting aside political or historical differences, otherwise we have to say that humanity has died."
Many are advising Pakistan to learn from India.
Many are saying that Pakistan should equip its system.
Tuba Jamali tweeted, "India's health system collapses even though it is better than ours. 
This strain of Covid-19 is extremely dangerous. 
Pakistan should be locked down immediately. 
We cannot afford to increase the number of patients due to lack of oxygen."
The third wave of corona is spreading rapidly in Pakistan. 
The number of patients here is also increasing rapidly. 
The burden on hospitals in Pakistan is also increasing.
In the last 24 hours, 5480 new corona patients were found in Pakistan.
Corona also reported 144 deaths.
The highest number of deaths have been reported in Punjab.
The number of patients in need of ventilators and oxygen beds is increasing rapidly in the major cities of the country.
Virafin drug for treatment of corona allowed in India for emergency use
As the Corona outbreak peaked across the country, there was some promising news. 
It is Zydus Cadilla, a healthcare drug approved by the Board of Regulators of Drugs of India.
Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) has approved Zydus Cadillac Virafin for the treatment of patients with mild corona infection.
The full name of this drug is Pegylated Interferon alpha-2b or PegIFN.
This is an Emergency Approval and can be used in limited quantities, DCGI said.
The company had said in its application to DCGI, "The drug helps patients recover faster and reduces the complications involved in their treatment."
He had also said that the drug would be given to patients in hospitals or special treatment institutions only on a doctor's prescription.
Tests conducted at 20-25 locations across the country found that the use of the drug Virafin reduced the patient's need for oxygen.
That is, virafin was helping to improve respiration.
The drug could also be used to treat other viral infections, the company said in an application to DCGI.
This means that to some extent, the drugs that used to be relied upon to save patients' lives are now likely to be reduced.
In addition, Zydus Cadila is working on a corona vaccine. 
The vaccine, called ZycovD, is being developed on a DNA platform. 
For this, Zydus Cadilla is enlisting the help of the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India.  
And the third phase of its clinical trials has been completed.
Corona: Just ambulances everywhere, piles of corpses, anguish
The second wave of covid in the country is infecting in a dangerous manner. 
Corona is located in Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state in the country.
As the corona continues to spread, it is becoming clear that the system is becoming inadequate. 
Although the administration claimed that things were under control, people expressed their grievances to the BBC.
Kanwajjit Singh's father Niranjan Pal Singh, 58, died on Friday while being transported from one hospital to another.
Four hospitals had refused to admit them due to unavailability of beds.
Speaking from Kanpur, he said, "This is the worst day of my life for me."
 If Baba had been treated on time, his life would have been saved. 
The police, the health administration, the government, no one helped us.
Since the corona crisis hit the country last year, 8,51,620 people have been infected in Uttar Pradesh. 
In Uttar Pradesh, corona killed 9,830 people.
 At the time of the first wave, the situation in Uttar Pradesh was not so dire. 
The second wave has put people in a vulnerable position.
Officials say the situation is under control.
However, the huge crowds at hospitals in Lucknow, Varanasi, Kanpur and Allahabad, the capital of Uttar Pradesh, the number of patients being sent back due to lack of beds, and the situation of cheetahs burning 24 hours a day in cemeteries have become a topic of discussion at the national level.
The largest state in the country
With a population of 24 crore, Uttar Pradesh is the most populous state in the country. 
The sixth citizen of the country is a resident of this state, so big is this state. 
Geographically, if Uttar Pradesh were an independent country, it would have become the largest country in the world after China, India, USA and Indonesia. 
Uttar Pradesh would have had more area than Pakistan and Brazil.
Uttar Pradesh is also important politically. 
Though Prime Minister Narendra Modi is originally from Gujarat, he had won the election from Varanasi. 
It is their constituency. 
Uttar Pradesh has 80 MPs in Parliament. 
Despite the strength in Parliament, ie at the national level, development in Uttar Pradesh is not as it should be.
There are 1,91,000 active cases of corona in Uttar Pradesh. 
The number of patients infected with corona is increasing every day.
The high number of people infected with the corona has raised questions about the state government's health care system. 
Those infected with the corona include Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, cabinet colleagues, dozens of officials, hundreds of doctors, nurses and health workers.
In the last few days I have spoken to many in Uttar Pradesh. 
In a video shared by a journalist working in Kanpur, a patient is lying on the ground in the parking lot of Lala Lajpat Rai Government Hospital. 
A short distance away, an elderly man is sitting on the bench. 
Both of them have corona but they are in such a condition as the bed is not available.
Outside the government's own Kanshiram Hospital, a girl cries as two hospitals refuse to admit her ailing mother.
The girl was crying, the hospital said, adding that she did not have a bed.
 If there is no bed, at least keep it on the floor but treat it. 
There are many people like me. 
 I have seen many patients being sent back.
The CM says there are enough beds. 
Show me where the beds are?
The situation in the capital Lucknow is just as bad.
A photo of Sushil Kumar Srivastava sitting in a car and wearing a face mask is on social media. 
He was rushed to his home to be admitted to the hospital. 
By the time they got to bed, it was too late.
We called his son Ashish. 
He said he had not recovered from the grief and could not speak. 
You know what happened. 
I'm not in a position to speak anymore.
The letter written in Hindi by retired Judge Ramesh Chandra was shared by many on social media.
His wife had a corona.
He requested the administration in a letter to take his wife's body out of the house for cremation. 
But they did not get any answer from anyone.
He wrote in the letter- My wife and I had a corona. 
 Called several government helpline numbers since yesterday. 
Called at least fifty times.
But no one came to give medicine, to take him to the hospital. 
My wife died because of poor administration.
Nirmala Kapoor, 70, who had been living in Varanasi, Modi's constituency, for several years, died at a hospital here on Thursday.
His son Vimal Kapoor said the situation was dire.
Vimal says, I have seen many die in ambulances.
Hospitals are not ready to admit patients because they do not have adequate facilities. 
Shopkeepers do not have drugs as well as injections. 
Oxygen is not enough.
The mother was taken to the cemetery where there was a pile of dead bodies.
The price of wood for the cheetah was tripled.
he funeral takes half an hour.
The bodies were so large that it took five to six hours.
I have never seen such a scene before.
Ambulances and piles of corpses everywhere you look.
The real picture is not in front of the public
The number of corona patients in the state is increasing day by day between the deaths due to covid and the families devastated by it. 
On Sunday, 30,596 new patients were registered in Uttar Pradesh. 
Most patients became infected with corona in one day.
Opposition leaders and activists have not been able to give a true picture of the Corona outbreak.
he state is not conducting large-scale corona tests and is protesting against allegations that the true number of corona deaths is being concealed due to non-compliance with private laboratory statistics.
Opponents claim the facts are clear.
Many of the people we spoke to had not been tested.
Although many were corona positive, their names were not registered in state government statistics.
Ajay Singh, 62, of Lucknow, sent me his wife's positive report.
However, his wife's name is not mentioned in the list of positive patients on the state government's website.
The names of Niranjan Singh of Kanpur and Nirmala Kapoor of Varanasi were among the deaths due to corona in the state but the death certificate did not mention corona death.
The media has also questioned the government's corona death toll.
According to media reports, there is a mismatch between the deaths in Lucknow and Varanasi due to cheetah burns and corona deaths.
The government missed the opportunity
Anshuman Rai, director of Heritage Hospital, a private hospital in Varanasi, said the current situation was unprecedented. 
Many doctors, nurses, health workers, lab technicians are falling ill as the health system collapses.
In such a situation where we have to contribute two hundred per cent, we cannot contribute even one hundred per cent.
Because the health system is completely dependent on manpower.
Opposition groups called for a boycott of the by-elections in protest of the second wave.
Nothing was done between September and February. 
Opposition groups called for the beleagured PM to resign. 
The state could also deposit medicines along with the Oxygen Bank. 
But the government missed the opportunity.
As the Corona monster spreads rapidly, there is no hope of recovery.
Corona virus: What is the type of virus in India? 
Scientists around the world are researching a new strain of corona virus found in India. 
But it is not yet clear how far it has spread and how much it has to do with the second, more deadly wave of covid in India.
What is the variant in India?
Changes in all viruses are called mutations. 
This leads to many variants of the virus.
Many of these mutations are not even noticeable, some mutations weaken the virus but some make it more contagious, making it harder for the vaccine to affect it.
The Indian variant - B1617 - was first seen in October.
Where is the Indian variant spread?
The scope of sample testing in India is not enough to say where and how fast this variant of corona has spread.
It was found in 220 samples, or 61% of the 361 genome sequencing samples in Maharashtra between January and March.
According to the GISAD database, the Indian corona has been found in 21 countries.
The UK's health minister says 103 cases of mutations found in India have been found in the UK. 
This is likely to have happened due to international travel.
 The majority of passengers coming from India are now banned by the UK.
Public Health England has categorized the Indian variant as a 'research variant', but has not yet classified it as a 'worrying variant'.
Is India's corona more contagious or dangerous?
A virologist at Louisiana State University, Dr. Jeremy Camille says, "One of the mutations in the Indian variant is similar to the one found in South Africa and Brazil.
Experts say it is too early to say whether the Corona variant in India is more dangerous than the UK mutation.
The UK variant is spread across more than 50 countries.
Why so little information about the Indian variant?
Experts say that information about the Indian variant is still incomplete.
The Indian variant has received 298 samples from India and 656 samples from around the world, while the UK variant has 384,000 samples available.
The first patients of this variant were registered in India. 
Since then, less than 400 patients of this variant have been registered worldwide,Says Kamil.
The new variant responsible for the second wave?
More than two lakh patients have been found in India every day since April 15, with the highest number of patients in the first wave being 93,000. 
The death toll is also steadily rising.
Ravi Gupta, a professor of clinical microbiology at Cambridge University,says, "India's huge population and density are conducive to mutations in the virus."
But behind the second wave of covid could be a large crowd, as well as a lack of adherence to masks and social distance.
Dr. Jeffrey Barrett of the Wellcome Singer Institute says, "The new variant may be the cause of the increase in morbidity, but it requires solid evidence."
Dr Barrett says the variant has been around since the end of 2020.
"If this variant is behind the second wave, it has taken months for that to happen, so we can say that it is less contagious than Kent's B117 variant."
Will the vaccine work on the new variant?
Experts say that all of these new types of coronavirus vaccine will help prevent serious illness caused by the coronavirus.
Some variants will sidestep the existing vaccines but will require some changes in the composition of the vaccines. 
The existing vaccines will help slow down the spread of the virus, experts say.
Dr. Jeremy Camille says, "Whether you get sick or have mild symptoms, there is a risk of death and it's time to be hospitalized.
 It depends on whether you get vaccinated or not. 
The first thing you get is to get rid of the vaccine. Don't. "
'Hang' if oxygen supply is disrupted - Delhi High Court
The Delhi High Court has warned that if any administrative authority at the central, state or local level interferes with the supply of oxygen, we will not let it go.
The court made the remarks during a hearing before a two-judge bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli on oxygen scarcity in Delhi.
Maharaja Agrasen Hospital in Delhi has filed a petition regarding the shortage of oxygen. 
The petition is being heard.
"The Delhi government should give an example of those who disrupt the supply of oxygen to Delhi. 
The Delhi Government should inform the Central Government about such officers. 
So that action can be taken against them, the High Court has said.
The court slammed the central government
During the hearing, the High Court also slammed the central government.
You had promised on April 21 that Delhi would be supplied 480 metric tonnes of oxygen daily.
But when will this happen?
Most of the hospitals in the capital Delhi are deficient in oxygen.
It is affecting critically ill patients.
On Friday (April 23), 20 people died due to lack of oxygen at Jaipur Golden Hospital in Delhi.
While government hospitals like LNJP and private hospitals like Saroj and Fortis Hospital are also experiencing oxygen shortage.
Oxygen shortages in Delhi hospitals
Oxygen deficiency has claimed the lives of 20 patients at the Jaipur Golden Hospital in Delhi.
Some oxygen tankers have been admitted to the hospital after the Jaipur Golden Hospital informed that there was only half an hour's supply of oxygen.
Two days ago, the central government had increased the oxygen quota for Delhi.
Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had also thanked the Center for that.
But at the same time, Delhi's Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia had said that even with the quota increase, the supply of oxygen from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh was being disrupted.
Chief Minister Kejriwal discussed the matter with Haryana Chief Minister Manoharlal Khattar.
At that time, he had promised full cooperation to Delhi, Kejriwal had said.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Modi held a high-level meeting on oxygen and directed the states to supply oxygen.
Oxygen shortage is also seen in Maharashtra.
Health Minister Rajesh Tope has also expressed concern over this.
Submit a detailed plan to fight against Corona- Supreme Court
The Supreme Court has slammed the central government for taking cognizance of the Corona situation in the country. 
The Supreme Court has sent a notice to the Central Government. 
The Supreme Court has asked the Modi government what is your plan on the situation in the country.
A three-member committee headed by Chief Justice Sharad Bobade took note of the shortage of oxygen, shortage of medicines and lack of facilities.
The current situation is worrisome, the chief justice said.
The Center has said that it should take definite measures regarding the supply of oxygen to the states, the status of medicines and vaccines.
Corona vaccine: 'Take one dose of the vaccine, but reduce the risk of infection at all ages'
"Even a single dose of Oxford AstraZeneca (also known as Covishield in India) or Pfizer vaccines can reduce the incidence of Covid-19 infection," said a study in the UK.
The vaccine has benefited senior citizens over 75 years of age, patients with comorbidities and other citizens of all ages.
A study by The Office for National Statistics and Oxford University found that both types of vaccines produced strong antibody responses at all ages.
He said people who had been vaccinated with either vaccine had a similar response.
This research consisted of two study essays, which have not yet been published or reviewed by other researchers. 
But the research studied 370,000 people in the UK. 
This is the first study to study such a large number of people.
This study does not include controlled trials, but real-world study findings.
Exactly how the vaccine works against Covid-19 shows how people are protected from the corona virus.
The first study found that people who took a single dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca (Covishield) or Pfizer vaccine had a 65 percent lower risk of contracting the new corona virus.
Protection from new variants
A study of vaccines administered between December 2020 and April 2021 found that 3 weeks after vaccination, the incidence of asymptomatic infections decreased by 74%, while the incidence of asymptomatic infections decreased by 57%.
Those who received a second dose of Pfizer had a 90 percent lower risk of infection.
But in the case of Oxford-AstraZeneca, this could not be confirmed because very few people in the study received a second dose of the vaccine.
But the study found that both vaccines work against the Kent variant (B117), which was prevalent in the UK at the time.
Dr. Coen Powells, who works in the Department of Population Health at Nutfield, Oxford, said:
"The protection given after the first dose proves that there should be a gap of 12 weeks between the first and second doses. 
This will increase the duration of protection from the first dose and reduce the number of patients admitted to the hospital as well as the mortality rate."
However, he emphasized that people who have been vaccinated can also be infected with covid and should follow social distances and wear masks even after being vaccinated.
A second study found a strong antibody response in about 46,000 adults who took the first dose of the vaccine. 
This means that the vaccine strengthens the body's immune system to fight the corona virus.
The researchers said the antibody response "lasted about 10 weeks."
After the Oxford-Astrazeneka vaccine, the body's antibody response gradually increased, and their levels decreased. 
Antibody response increased rapidly after vaccination with Biotech-Pfizer but also declined rapidly, especially in the elderly.
Antibody response in people over 80 years of age
After taking both doses of the vaccine, the response was better in the young than in the old. 
However, the study found that after Pfizer vaccination, antibody levels increased in all age groups.
But one finding that surprised researchers was that after the second dose of the vaccine, the immune response increased significantly in people over the age of 80 - many times more than even in young people.
Researchers say this research underscores the importance of taking both doses of the vaccine. 
But it is not yet clear how antibodies are formed after vaccination of covid.
The main researcher of this research is Pvt. "It's not yet clear exactly how much antibody response people will need or how long it will take to save people from Covid-19 for a long time," said Sarah Walker.
How are different variants of the Corona found in different countries?
At the end of 2020, a new variant of the Corona was found in India, which was previously found in the UK.
According to health officials, genetic mutations in the corona virus may be more contagious. 
Furthermore, even current corona vaccines may fail to provide complete protection against it. 
More study on this is of course needed.
What is the new variant of Corona virus in India?
Thousands of types of corona currently exist.
More than 100 cases of corona variants in India have been found in the UK.
This Indian variant is also called as B.1.617. 
This may seem like a big number. 
However, this is only one per cent of the genetic mutations analyzed in the UK.
According to the Department of Public Health in England, some of these cases are not related to international cases. 
The search is on to find out how they got infected.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has canceled a visit to India. 
Moreover, England has put India on a 'red list' to prevent the spread of corona through passengers.
However, there is no information or statistics yet to confirm that the Indian variant of the Corona is a 'Variant of Cocern'. 
The concept is used for variants in the UK, Brazil and South Africa.
Or, this variant does not appear to be directly responsible for the recent increase in coronary heart disease in India.
What are the variants in UK, Brazil and South Africa?
New strains of the corona can also become more rapidly infected and weaken the immune system.
The UK or Kent variant (also known as B.1.1.7) is currently seen in many parts of the UK. 
The same variant has been found in more than 50 countries and is changing again.
The South African variant (also known as B.1.351) has been found in at least 20 countries, including the UK.
It is not unexpected that a new variant has been created.
 As the virus spreads, it changes its form and spreads.
The changes in most of these viruses are inconsistent. 
Some variants are endangered, while others are more contagious.
Are the new variants more dangerous?
No evidence has yet been found that the new variants could have a more serious effect on a patient infected with the corona.
Depending on the original type of corona, older people and those with other ailments may also face more stress in these variants.
Considering the UK variants, some research has suggested that the risk of patient death could increase by 30 per cent. 
However, this evidence cannot be considered as a final conclusion.
To prevent infection, you need to be more careful about hand washing, keeping distance, and wearing a mask.
How are the new variants changing?
Variants in the UK, South Africa, Brazil and India have seen changes in their spike protein.
The virus infects human cells.
The mutation virus, known as N501Y, has been shown to be more potent in infecting and spreading cells.
According to experts, the UK and Kent variants are more than 70 per cent contagious. 
According to the UK Department of Public Health, the same percentage is between 30 and 50 per cent.
Variants from South Africa and Brazil have been shown to be more capable of turning into spike proteins
his involved a significant genetic mutation called E484K.
Therefore, they can penetrate the human body's immune system i.e. antibodies. 
These antibodies are already given to you by infection or by vaccination.
They can fight corona on previous experience of infection or due to vaccine.
Experts have also noticed this change in some UK variants recently.
Some important changes have been found in the Indian variants (E484Q, L452R and P681R), which may save the immune system. 
Therefore, experts are currently studying it urgently.
Can the vaccine fight with the Corona variants?
The corona vaccine is actually made with the original virus in mind.
However, experts believe that the new variant may not be as effective as it should be, but at least it may be useful.
According to a recent study, the Brazilian variant can resist antibodies in those who have already had a corona and have some degree of immunity.
Some laboratory findings and factual information suggest that the Pfizer vaccine may be effective on newer variants. 
However, the extent of this effectiveness is low.
The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine team suggests that the vaccine is equally effective against the new UK variant
However, while the vaccine may be less effective against the South African variant, it does prevent patients from becoming serious.
The modern vaccine works effectively against the South African variant.
The immune response may not be as strong or long lasting.
Although two new vaccines, Novavax and Johnson, have not yet been approved, they appear to be defending variants of the corona.
According to experts, even if the new virus changes, so can the vaccine.
The UK government has announced that it has already signed an agreement with biopharmaceutical company CureVac to develop a vaccine that fights new variants.
In addition, 5 crore doses have already been ordered.
Ashok Tupe: The last words written by a journalist who died due to corona were
Ashok Tupe, a senior journalist from Ahmednagar, died of a heart attack after recovering from a corona.
Three senior journalists died on Thursday (April 22nd) amid a sharp rise in the number of corona patients in the state.
These include Ahmednagar Lok Sabha MP Ashok Tupe, Osmanabad senior journalist Motichand Bedmutha and Sopan Bongane.
In Delhi too, some journalists have died due to corona.
News laundry journalist Ashish Yechury's death in Corona has sparked mourning in journalism circles.
The number of journalists killed by corona in Maharashtra has now reached 105, the Marathi Press Council has informed.
In Corona's time, many journalists have reported on the field, considered essential services but not frontline workers. 
That's why many journalists who go to the field at risk have not yet received the corona vaccine, say veteran journalism veterans.
Who was Ashok Tupe?
Ahmed Tupe, a senior journalist from Ahmednagar, has died of a heart attack after recovering from a corona. 
Tupe has been undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Ahmednagar for the past several days.
Ashok Tupe was an important name in the field of journalism in the state.
He was honored with the Vasantrao Naik Agricultural Journalist Award of the Government of Maharashtra. 
Originally from Shrirampur, he was working as a correspondent for the Ahmednagar edition of the Loksatta newspaper.
Ashok Tupe was instrumental in co-operation, agriculture, rural development, politics. 
He also studied many things from anthropology to history, ABP said.
Last message goes viral
Ashok Tupe had sent a message to one of his relatives while he was suffering from corona. 
This message is now going viral.
In the message, Ashok Tupe says, "I have covid and I am undergoing treatment.
 I was traveling in a car with a friend when I was hit by a corona.
Use a double mask.
Don't take off the mask until you get home.
I'm having a bad experience.
The phone is off.
The boy is texting because he's out.
Be careful. 
Don't go to shraddha, funeral, wedding, sugarplum or other events. 
Don't be too crowded.
My wife and I are both being treated in the same room.
 It's been six days. 
But now nature is stable. "
A few days after this message, Ashok Tupe passed away.
His covid was healed. 
But in the end, he died of a heart attack.
Many people are paying homage to Tupe by keeping his message status.
People are making each other aware of the danger and dire situation of the corona.
State President of Maharashtra Youth Congress Satyajit Tambe paid homage to him.
He said that he was saddened by Tupe's demise.
BJP leader Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil has also paid homage to him. 
He lost a learned friend who worked on agricultural co-operation and rural issues, he said.
Three journalists killed on the same day
Three journalists, including Ashok Tupe, were killed in the same day in the state.
Motichand Bedmutha, the founder of Samay Sarathi in Osmanabad, former president of Osmanabad District Marathi Journalists Association, a senior journalist, passed away in Hyderabad today. 
He was 69 years old.
He was currently working as the Maharashtra State Representative of Osmanabad District Marathi Press Association. 
He served as the Osmanabad district correspondent of the Maharashtra Times and was the founding editor of the Osmanabad-based daily Samay Sarathi.
Sopan Bongane, a senior journalist from Thane, also passed away in Pune today.
The number of journalists killed in the state due to corona has now reached 105, informed S. of Marathi Press Council. M. Deshmukh as well as senior journalist Jatin Desai have also given.
The death of three senior journalists on the same day in the state has spread mourning in the field of journalism along with their families.
Journalists should get the status of frontline worker - Nikhil Wagle
Corona's death has been widely reported on social media by senior journalists in the state.
On this occasion, senior journalist Nikhil Wagle has once again demanded that journalists should get the status of frontline workers.

Maharashtra Lockdown: 9 questions in your mind and their answers
Restrictions in Maharashtra have been tightened under the state government's 'Break the Chain' initiative.
Implementation of the new rules began April 8, at 8 p.m. 
But there are still many questions in the minds of ordinary people.
Here are 9 important questions and their answers.
1. Can doctors and people in the medical field travel in the district without any restrictions?
Answer - Yes. 
Doctors and people in the medical field can travel within the district using the identity card issued by the administration. 
They can use private / private or public vehicles for this journey.
But the reason for their trip is expected to be related to medical and health.
2. Who can use local train?
A. Local trains in Mumbai can be used only by government employees / officials and health workers. 
Apart from them, no one is allowed to travel by local. 
Employees of essential services who are exempted in exceptional circumstances as per the order of the government will not be allowed to travel by local train.
3. Who can take the service of taxi or rickshaw?
Answer : Taxis or rickshaws can be used by the people who have been included in the required services or concessions as per the government order as well as for some valid reasons like going to exams, going to the airport and going to the railway station or bus station to catch long distance trains.
Taxis or rickshaws can also be used in medical emergencies.
4. Is inter-district travel allowed?
Answer - Inter-district travel by private car or other means of transportation will be permitted only for essential purposes other than buses and long-distance trains. 
Essential causes include medical emergencies, family deaths.

Corona: Is the doctor's mental health deteriorating?
The husband of a nurse working at Kasturba Hospital contracted corona.
He was admitted to Kasturba Hospital.
I used to talk to him every day.
I used to do counseling.
I used to believe that you would get better.
"Our nurse used to tell me every day, sir, please do something.
She had to be put on a ventilator for 28 days.
But then she died.
The nurse was pregnant at the time.
I was numb after her husband died.
Looking at the nurse's face, she remembers the incident.
Couldn't you do anything? This question comes to my mind again and again.
My family calls me, you don't talk like before, you don't smile.
Why are you so tense?
The current situation, the deaths due to inadequate facilities and the struggle to save new patients by leaving them behind.
The condition of the patients is constantly in front of our eyes.
What if this situation befalls our family?
This fear does not go away.
Dr. Kasturba Hospital in Mumbai. 
Sahil Moriwala was sharing his experience. 
He had a sore throat while saying this. 
Moriwala had also treated the very first patient in Mumbai. 
He has been serving patients ever since.
There are 200-250 patients in my ward.
5-10 of them are in critical condition.
They need ventilators to be moved to the intensive care unit.
But since there is no space in the intensive care unit, they just have to be put on oxygen.
Many patients have lost their lives due to this.
At that time, we are helpless, "Sahil added.
The whole country is currently on the run in the second wave of Covid. 
The condition of the doctors at the center of the wave has also worsened. 
While returning the first wave of Kasambas, the same second wave has collided more intensely. 
So doctors are physically tired. 
But maintaining morale is also a major challenge for them. 
We tried to know the plight of other doctors like Sahil on the same subject.
Bharat Jain, who works as a visiting doctor in some hospitals in Dombivli, shares his experience. 
He says, "A 34-year-old pregnant woman went on a ventilator.
The hospital ran out of oxygen.
The day ends thinking about what will happen tomorrow.
Young patients die.
"Patients with stroke have to be sent home with medication.
The tension we go through every day comes home automatically.
It affects the family."
Prasanna Phutane, who works at Sassoon Hospital in Pune, is no different.
"In the morning, the whole lobby is full of patients.
Many are cowardly positive.
Some are begging for beds, some are crying, some are crying.
"Many people are crying and saying, 'There is no space in our house. Admit our patient here.'
How and how much to explain to the relatives of the patients?
So we have been enduring this every day for the last year.
If I have a bed, why don't I give it to you?
I am not your enemy.
How can I explain this to the relatives of the patients? "
Prashant Munde, a resident doctor working at Sassoon Hospital, says, "Patients' relatives often shout at us.
You don't have beds?
No oxygen?
No injections. What are you doing?
The government is angry with us.
But we can't say anything. "
More stress in young doctors?
This situation is not only for doctors in big cities but also for doctors all over the world. 
According to some global researchers, including Corona, mental health complaints are more prevalent among healthcare workers in the UK, US, Italy, China and India.
A survey conducted by the psychiatric department at Sassoon Hospital found that doctors in the hospital's medicine department had a 70-75% reduction in mental stress and desire to work. 
Other doctors found 50% stress and burnout (unwillingness to work).
Psychiatrist Dr. Rajendra Barve says, "The Indian Medical Association had organized a camp on mental health for doctors.
The response to this camp was twice as high as before.
The number of resident doctors in particular was higher.
The lives of those resident doctors have changed with this."
There is not much time left in the lives of Corona patients to do other than treat their patients.
The frustration with the system, the work they have to do against their will, puts those doctors under a lot of stress.
Experienced doctors have a degree of depression and anxiety.
How to keep mental health healthy?
At present, it is not possible for a doctor to go on vacation, have fun or spend more time with family. 
We have to face constant negative situations. 
Patients have to face the wrath of their relatives.
 We have to work against our will without learning what we have come to learn.
For this, psychiatrist Dr. Rajendra Barve says, "Doctors should do a 'micro vacation'.
This means that even if you get 5-10 minutes a day, you should try to get out of this situation mentally.
We could not save some patients due to inadequate facilities. Should be done.
"Patients, their relatives are angry about the system.
Even if they are blaming you for the current situation, they know what the doctor's fault is somewhere.
If such a situation arises, it should be handled positively.
What you are doing is an opportunity as a doctor.
I have to make up my mind that I will use the opportunity. "
Corona: Had it not been for the lockdown, the situation in Maharashtra would have been dire
If people are not careful, the number of deaths per day in India from the first week of June will be over 2,300," the statement may seem a bit exaggerated, but a report has been published in the prestigious Lancet.
Maharashtra has been hit the hardest by the second wave of corona. 
 This article tries to find out how the situation in Maharashtra would have been if it had not been for the lockdown.
Strict lockdown is being implemented in Maharashtra from today (April 22). 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said that states should consider lockdown as a last resort. 
Then there was a lot of debate about whether there would be a lockdown in the state.
It is also said that the number of corona patients in the state would have gone up to one million in a fortnight if there had not been a lockdown.
Will the number of patients cross 10 lakh by May 2?
There are currently 6,83,856 active patients of corona in the state. 
The number of patients is estimated to be 10,94,996 by May 2, according to the administration.
The state has a shortage of hospital beds, oxygen and ventilators.
 The administration fears that with the increase in the number of patients, the shortage of bed facilities, oxygen and ventilators in the hospital will increase and the situation will get out of hand.
As per the above data, the number of beds for patients is deficient in 28 out of 35 districts in the state. 
If a strict lockdown is imposed, this situation is likely to change to some extent.
Speaking to media after the cabinet meeting on Tuesday (April 20), Health Minister Rajesh Tope had said, "Given the current situation, every minister in the cabinet meeting should have a strict lockdown.
If the chain is to be broken, there is no alternative but strict lockdown, so all the ministers are urging the Chief Minister to announce the decision soon.
We use 80-90% of hospital beds, oxygen, injections, medicines and doctors.
 Currently there is a community outbreak. 
If the chain is to be broken, strict restrictions will have to be imposed on essential service shops and large-scale traffic, otherwise it will be difficult to bear the burden on the health system. "
Koronacam crisis had severe active ?
As of March 31, the number of corona patients in the state was around 40,000 a day. 
In the last 20 days, the number has gone up to 62,000 a day. 
This is a daily increase of about 22,000 patients in the last twenty days. 
Although this figure appears to be large, the administration says it has also increased the number of corona tests.
According to the report of the Lancet Covid 19 Commission, "If people do not take precautions, the number of corona deaths in the country will be 1750 per day and the number could rise to 2320 from the first week of June." 
The worst of this situation in the country could reach Maharashtra.
There is a huge strain on the health system in the state. 
Beds for patients, oxygen, remedesivir injections are feeling a big tread.
Suresh Boinwad, an ambulance driver at Nanded District Hospital, said, "Last week I got a call that a patient was critical.
I took the 80-year-old patient to the hospital in an ambulance but was told there was no bed.
The bed was not found.
How would I leave the patient on the road? Where would I leave him? I wondered.
The patient had to be kept in the ambulance for a long time.
Then late at night his relatives found a way.
Could this prediction be wrong?
If the number in the state exceeds 10 lakhs, what will happen to the health system? 
Shashank Joshi, chief doctor of the Covid Task Force, said, "These figures were predicted during the first wave of corona.
But often they turned out to be wrong.
Although the numbers are not complete due to the current restrictions, it seems to be stabilizing at 60,000. 
I don't think it will increase to millions in the future. 
On the other hand, the number will stabilize and start declining. 
But for that, people have to sit at home and observe the restrictions. "
Can a complete lockdown make a difference in this situation? 
On this Dr. Shashank Joshi says, "A complete lockdown should be considered when your health system is not functional.
I am not in favor of a personal lockdown.
There should be strict restrictions in the districts where the health system is lacking, and especially the people should abide by it."
Has Modi made a political dilemma of Uddhav Thackeray to avoid lockdown?
While talking about lockdown in Maharashtra, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that states should have lockdown as a last resort. 
But still there was a lockdown in Maharashtra.
He made the statement to avoid public outrage after the lockdown and said that if the lockdown occurs, the responsibility will fall on the states.
Uddhav Thackeray threatened to take a decision that was not in the interest of the people and announced a lockdown. 
Against this backdrop, there is talk that Modi tried to use Uddhav Thackeray's political dilemma to 'avoid lockdown', saying that he made the statement to keep the country's economy afloat. 
BBC Marathi has tried to find out this question.
While the state of Maharashtra was on the verge of a complete lockdown, Prime Minister Modi's instructions to the states about the lockdown were a surprise to them.
Its political repercussions began to emerge in Maharashtra. 
The politics between the Center and the state government, which has been going on for several days, is not stopping.
 Corona doesn't even have time.
On what basis is the Prime Minister's advice to avoid lockdown?
The ongoing lockdown in Maharashtra is being discussed all over the country. 
This time, Prime Minister Modi's statement to avoid lockdown was especially against the decision of the Mahavikas Aghadi government.
As a result, the leaders of the Mahavikas Aghadi have targeted the Prime Minister's speech. 
In the front page of the match, Sanjay Raut says, "64,000 patients are coming to Maharashtra in 24 hours.
The death rate has also increased.
On what basis does Prime Minister Narendra Modi advise to avoid lockdown?"
Corona status has gone out of control in Delhi, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.
The BJP has mobilized people from all over the country for West Bengal.
They have infected the corona and returned to various states.
Haridwar's Kumbh Mela, political fairs in West Bengal have only infected the country with corona."
That is what the match has said.
Sanjay Raut further says, "Modi says we want to return this crisis together.
There is no place for people with opposing views in this unity".
Even during the Corona period, the politics of the state government against the central government continued. 
Giving evidence from the last several days, Raut criticized Prime Minister Modi over the lockdown.
NCP leader and minister Jitendra Awhad has also targeted Modi's speech.
 Jitendra Awhad says, "Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that lockdown could be the last resort.
Where have we forgotten, when you suddenly came one day.
When any Chief Minister did not know any Union Cabinet Minister, you suddenly came and declared lockdown.
How much water to look at?
No CM is happy with the lockdown. 
But for the way corona is spreading in Maharashtra, lockdown is needed. 
Prime Minister Modiji, you should appreciate Maharashtra ".
Modi shifted responsibility to states?
In a statement, Prime Minister Narendra Modi lauded the central government's good vaccinations and the fight against corona in the first wave.
Even in the current situation, the central government has tried to show how much effort is being made to make oxygen remedial injections available. 
But what is the politics behind saying avoid lockdown?
Business Standard journalist Aditi Fadnavis says, "Prime Minister Modi has said for the second time that lockdown should be the last resort.
He had said in a meeting with all the state chief ministers that lockdown should be the last resort.
Shortly after this meeting, restrictions were imposed in Madhya Pradesh.
Then why didn't they listen to the Prime Minister? "
Either Modi is unaware of the current situation on the ground or the prime minister wants to shift the responsibility to the state.
But even the state government is finding it difficult to control the situation," said Aditi Fadnavis.
In states where there is no BJP government, states speak against Modi.
But in states where there is a BJP-led government, they cannot speak.
In today's situation, if one goes to the working class and asks who is responsible for this situation?
So, one will seldom mention the name of Prime Minister Modi.
But most people will say that the state government has not done anything.
The politics of shirking responsibility is going on right now," says Aditi Fadnavis.
Oxygen supply: 'Beg, borrow, steal but give oxygen', High Court orders Modi govt 
1. 'Beg, borrow, steal; But give oxygen '- Delhi High Court
Beg, borrow, steal; But give oxygen ', is the word the Delhi High Court has given to the Central Government. 
Loksatta has given this news.
The Delhi High Court has slammed the Modi government after Max Hospital in Delhi filed a petition in the Delhi High Court alleging inadequate supply of oxygen.
A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Patil of the Delhi High Court heard the petition filed by Max Healthcare. 
Max had complained in his petition that there was an insufficient supply of oxygen.
The apex court asked the Center, "Aren't people's lives so important to the government?
We are shocked by the central government's neglect of such an important issue as oxygen.
If necessary, divert oxygen from industries such as steel and petroleum for treatment.
 Consider all the ways to get oxygen from the plant of this industry to the required place.
Even if a special corridor has to be created for that, the government should do it. "
2. Centre's new model for vaccine rate control
The corona vaccine has been available to everyone over the age of 18 since May 1. 
Since then, the government has been developing a mechanism to control the price of anti-corona vaccine in the open market. 
This was reported by Times of India .
While vaccine companies have the right to set their own vaccine in the open market, clinics and other vaccine suppliers may charge higher fees for vaccines.
So the government is thinking of creating a new mechanism to control these prices.
From May 1, private clinics will be able to purchase corona vaccines directly from manufacturers for vaccination of people over 18 years of age. 
There will be a fixed price for that.
 Anyway, everyone above the age of 45 will be provided free vaccines at government centers.
3. Door-to-door vaccination impossible - Ministry of Health
A public interest litigation has been filed in the Mumbai High Court seeking vaccination of senior citizens who have completed 75 years of age as it is not possible for them to go out for vaccination.
On this petition, the Union Ministry of Health submitted its affidavit in the High Court.
 ABP has given this news in my name.
It said that if a door-to-door vaccination campaign is carried out, the test period of 30 minutes after vaccination will not be observed, unfortunately, if any adverse effects of the vaccine are observed, it will not be possible to give immediate medical treatment. 
The corona vaccine needs to be kept at a certain temperature. 
However, the vaccine can be affected if the vaccinated container is carried around the house. 
Vaccine doses are also likely to be wasted during travel. 
The Central Government has mentioned many such reasons in its affidavit.
The affidavit states that more vaccination centers will be set up in the near future and citizens will be able to register for vaccination at the site.
4. Why Modi government did not give priority to citizens? - Priyanka Gandhi
"Why weren't the facilities built even though we knew that another wave of corona was coming?" This is the question that Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi has asked the Modi government. 
This was reported by Indian Express .
Priyanka Gandhi said, "Today there are reports of shortage of beds, oxygen, remedivisor, ventilators across the country.
We had a lot of time to prepare between the first and second waves.
Our country is the largest producer of oxygen.
So why is there a shortage of oxygen?
The facility has not been created.
Why didn't you give priority to the countrymen?
Because you are busy with publicity.
We were watching on TV that Mauritius, Nepal was being vaccinated.
You exported six crore vaccines and gave three to four crore vaccines to the people.
There is a shortage of policies today. "
"5. Corona will do, but will not go home - Rakesh Tikait
For the last 5 months, farmers have been protesting against the Agriculture Act on the Delhi border.
The agitation is claimed to be hampering the supply of oxygen to Delhi.
Commenting on this, farmer leader Rakesh Tikait has said that even if he gets corona, he will go but will not go home. 
Lokmat has given this news.
He asserted that his confession had been obtained through torture and that his confession had been obtained through torture. 
We are quarantined here. 
Corona, however, will be treated at Max Hospital here.
Lockdown Rules: Restrictions are even stricter, these are the 3 important announcements
The state's lockdown rules have been tightened under Break the Chain. 
This decision has been made to prevent the increasing prevalence of corona.
The rules issued on the 13th will be effective till May 1 with new additional rules.
 Let's find out what the new rules will be.
Wedding ceremony
Now only 25 people are allowed for the wedding ceremony. 
Earlier, 50 people were allowed to get married but now the number has halved. 
A wedding ceremony can be held in the same hall in 2 hours. 
Violation of the rules at the wedding ceremony will result in a fine of Rs 50,000.
Passenger transport
Inter-district travel can only be done for important reasons.
 Private car travel in Mumbai will be 50 per cent capacity.
 Private buses can run at 50 percent capacity. 
Cannot travel vertically.
Inter-district travel will require permission from the local emergency management.
Only essential service personnel will have access to the local train. 
Admission will be given after checking iCard.
Rules for government offices
Government offices will continue to operate at 15 per cent capacity.
At a cabinet meeting on Tuesday (April 20), the ministers also agreed to a tough lockdown decision.
Health Minister Rajesh Tope said that a demand was made in the cabinet meeting that citizens of the state should be vaccinated by imposing strict lockdown in the state.
It has been decided to impose strict lockdown in Maharashtra, informed Mumbai Guardian Minister Aslam Sheikh. 
He had said that the state government would announce the rules in this regard.
However, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has appealed to the states that lockdown should be the last resort. 
Modi had said that the lockdown should be considered as a last resort, as the lockdown would cause huge financial losses.
Against this backdrop, will Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, while interacting with the people of the state, announce a lockdown today? This has caught everyone's attention.
Strict restrictions were imposed in the state from April 14, including a curfew. 
However, public places are still crowded. 
It was also discussed in the cabinet meeting that people are leaving their homes in the name of necessary work and some concrete measures should be taken against it.
Grocery store hours are seven to eleven in the morning
The timing of grocery stores has also been changed by the government. 
The state government has decided to limit the time of grocery shops from 7 am to 11 am as citizens are out all day in the name of grocery shopping despite the restrictions.
Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar said that this decision had to be taken as many people in the state do not follow the rules of corona.
A meeting was held under the chairmanship of Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar to review the issues like enhancing health facilities in hospitals in the state, maintaining oxygen supply, overcoming the problems of doctors and health workers.
The meeting was attended by Health Minister Rajesh Tope, Urban Development Minister Eknath Shinde (via VC), Medical Education Minister Amit Deshmukh (via VC), Food and Drug Administration Minister Dr. Rajendra Shingane and other senior officers of the concerned departments were present.
New regulations for rail travel
Under the state government's 'Break the Chain' initiative, new regulations have now been announced for rail travel. 
Accordingly, those coming to Maharashtra from Kerala, Goa, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Delhi and Uttarakhand will have to show a negative report of the corona.
These six states have been declared corona sensitive. 
Railway passengers arriving in Maharashtra from this state are required to take 48 hours pre-RT-PCR test.
Many passengers may not have RT-PCR reports, in which case the railways should provide a facility for rapid antigen testing.
Corona vaccine price: Serum Institute announces vaccine rates for private hospitals
Serum Institute of India has announced vaccine rates. 
Vaccine manufacturers will now give 50 per cent of their production to the central government, while the remaining 50 per cent will be sold to state governments and private hospitals.
For government hospitals and vaccination centers, each dose of Covishield will be available at Rs 400, while private hospitals will be able to buy Covishield at Rs 600 per dose.
Private clinics will then charge their own vaccination fees and announce the rates for each dose of vaccine. 
Therefore, different private clinics are likely to have different rates for vaccination.
It is not yet clear at what rate the state government will sell the doses they have bought.
The Serum Institute said in a statement that it has reduced its rates worldwide for each dose of vaccine.
The 50 per cent vaccines that go to the central government will be distributed by the center to various states and union territories.
The central government had said that the decision would be taken after considering the infection situation in the area and the state administration's vaccination work.
Remdesivir: Did companies reduce supply in Maharashtra due to pressure from the central government? - Nana Patole
1. 'Has the supply of Remedesivir been reduced in Maharashtra due to pressure from the Central Government?' - Nana Patole
Is the Central Government putting pressure on Maharashtra not to supply Remedesivir? 
He also criticized the central government for failing in the Corona crisis, shifting its responsibility to the states and leaving the people to fend for themselves.
In Maharashtra, however, the Congress has demanded that the state government should take out timely loans but complete vaccinations.
 Lokmat has given this news.
The state government had issued two tenders for the supply of Remedesivir injection.
The two companies were supplying 50,000 injections per day to the state till now.
But they abruptly changed their position and asked for 500 injections by May 31.
Is the center trying to make things worse?
3. 'Don't be late for testing' - Rajesh Tope
Health Minister Rajesh Tope has said that the experience of getting sick due to delay is coming from all over the state.
 Therefore, if you see any symptoms of corona, do the test without delay, do not remove the pain on the body, Rajesh Tope has appealed.
He said, "If there are symptoms, start treatment by testing the corona in any situation.
After studying the situation across the state, it was found that the patient was dehydrated due to the delay.
So please do not remove the pain on the limb."
 Loksatta has given this news.
BP, diabetes, etc. 
Despite the disease, the vaccine is beneficial and will play an important role in protecting against the corona epidemic. 
Therefore, everyone over the age of 45 should be vaccinated, he said.
5. Economic interests cannot be greater than human life- Delhi High Court
The Delhi High Court has slammed the Center and the Delhi government for lack of oxygen and wasted vaccines.
The Delhi High Court has said in a hearing that financial interests cannot be greater than human life.
According to Suchitra Mohanty, a senior journalist covering law and court, a bench of Justices Vipin Sanghvi and Rekha Palli during a hearing on Tuesday (March 20) said the court would hear the case on a daily basis in the Corona crisis situation.
The court also said that the central government should immediately ban the industrial use of oxygen in view of the shortage of oxygen in Delhi's hospitals. 
The court said, "Economic interests cannot be more important than people's health.
Why can't oxygen be taken from the Ministry of Petroleum and given to the states?
If there is a shortage of oxygen now, give it now.
Why wait till the 22nd?"
The oxygen supply to some industries has been cut off since April 2, while others will be cut off from April 22, the Center told the court. T
he court slammed the central government for this.
Corona Oxygen Shortage: 'If You Can't Give Medicine and Beds, Give Me a Little Room to Die
I had this morning call. 
A schoolteacher called me. 
Her 46-year-old husband is battling Kovid in a Delhi hospital. 
There is a shortage of oxygen in that place. 
So they called me and asked if I could get an oxygen cylinder.
I spoke to myself. 
Breathing seems to be the order of the day in Delhi.
Hospitals in Delhi are working on a war footing to alleviate the oxygen shortage. 
Phones are texting about oxygen shortages.
When the woman's phone rang, I could clearly hear the beep of the monitor. 
She said her husband's oxygen level was 58. 
After a while it rose to 62. 
If your oxygen level falls below 92, you are advised to consult a doctor.
She says that her husband's oxygen level has increased and she is feeling better now.
I texted one of my doctor friends and asked what the oxygen level should be so that the patient would feel better.
 She says that even if the oxygen level is 40, the patient can talk to you.
'25 patients die due to lack of oxygen '
I picked up the newspaper. 
It read that 25 patients died due to lack of oxygen in a large hospital in Delhi. 
Critical care units are under tremendous stress due to lack of oxygen. 
Many patients are given oxygen manually. 
This means that oxygen is being delivered without the need for critical care equipment.
I was shocked to see a photo on the front page of the newspaper. 
Two men and a woman are getting oxygen supply from an oxygen cylinder.
The general public's recklessness about Kovid and the government's negligence brought the three strangers together in grief.
 read a news a few days ago. 
A man's 40-year-old son died while waiting for a bed outside the hospital.
 At least, he had a stretcher.
 That was mentioned in the news.
The bewildered Indians seem to be grateful for this too.
If you can't give us a bed, oxygen or medicine while you are alive, at least give us a place to burn at death, there are so many helpless people.
As the day progressed, I realized that nothing had changed.
People are dying due to lack of oxygen, the supply of medicine is not enough. 
Even in the black market, medicines are not available even after paying a lot of money. 
There are signs of medicine running out in the shops and people are buying medicines even when they are not needed out of fear. 
It's as if we're at war now.
n many ways, it is a fact that the current situation is warlike.
The teacher called again. 
The hospital did not even have an oxygen flow-meter. 
She was told to arrange it herself.
I phoned. 
Asked for people's help on Twitter. 
One person received it and arrangements were made to deliver it.
No matter what the government says, the situation seems to be getting worse and worse. 
Oxygen tankers do not arrive on time. 
No beds, no medicine.
The affluent class in India used to get some special privileges and good treatment. 
But it seems that their privileges have been taken away. 
I got a call from the editor of a magazine. 
He was looking for an oxygen cylinder for one of his acquaintances.
In the society in which I live, people have bought small oxygen concentrators.
 It helps people who are having difficulty breathing. 
In our society, 57 people have been infected with corona and have been quarantined in their homes.
Patients are left to die on their own. 
Many feel that they are slowly dying. 
Corona seems to be a disease with many monstrous faces.
Paul Kalanidhi, who is practicing in America, had written a book on his memories called 'When Breath Becomes Air'. 
Kalanidhi was diagnosed with lung cancer and died in 2015. 
He had written in his book. 
Although I am dying, even though I am on the verge of death, I am alive until I die.
His statement is coming true now. 
There are only a few things left in the lives of many Indians who are struggling for oxygen, with some compassion left.
Corona: Could India's oxygen shortage have been avoided?
"I was trying to breathe, but I couldn't.
I thought I was going to die."
Shruti (name has been changed as the girl concerned wants her parents not to read that she had to fight with Covid-19).
She put herself in isolation and began to feel that she was in good health.
But when she woke up on April 9, she was having difficulty breathing and her oxygen level had dropped.
"My husband was anxiously calling everywhere.
But most of the hospitals did not have space for new patients or oxygen."
After struggling to breathe for twelve hours, Shruti was finally admitted to a private hospital. 
But it took another two hours to get the bed together and start supplying oxygen.
Ten days later she was released from the hospital and now she is at her home in Mumbai, her health is also improving.
I still feel weak, but I'm glad I'm alive.
My luck was strong that day so I got to bed."
It's been two weeks since the incident, and now countless patients across India have to go through horrific experiences like Shruti - often with devastating consequences.
The battle for breath
Everyone from doctors, officials to journalists who have witnessed the spread of this epidemic in India now have to experience the unfortunate recurrence.
Seven months ago, the country was similarly struggling with oxygen shortages and the number of patients was increasing. 
But today the situation is even worse.
Thousands of people wait three to four days for a bed with oxygen available. 
Many are dying while waiting.
Hospitals have to work hard to accommodate inhaled covid patients, doctors are panicking over the depletion of oxygen stocks, and messages urging for oxygen cylinders are circulating everywhere from the news in the media, to Twitter and the WhatsApp.
How did India get back to this position?
"The situation was so bad that we had to treat some patients in a cardiac ambulance for 12 hours, after which they got beds in the ICU," said Dr. Krishna Kumar, who is the head of Covid Hospital in Pune, Siddheshwar Shinde says.
The number of covid patients in Maharashtra has remained the highest since the onset of this global outbreak. 
Even now, Maharashtra alone accounts for one-third of the total covid patients in India.
Pune is one of the most coveted districts in India. 
So far, Pune ranks second (1,21,200) in the number of corona patients, while Pune ranks third (8,890) in the number of deaths due to the virus.
One day last week when no ventilator was available, Dr. Shinde moved patients to other cities.
 This is unprecedented, as people from nearby districts often come to Pune for treatment. 
The situation is no different in Mumbai, the capital of Maharashtra and the financial center of India. 
About 95 per cent of emergency beds in Mumbai are full.
One-tenth of the total patients in Maharashtra require oxygen proof, experts estimate. 
But the supply of oxygen is not enough. 
Although the state produces about 1200 metric tons of oxygen per day, it has to be used for all oxygen covid patients.
Oxygen demand is also on the rise as the number of patients increases - currently the demand for oxygen in the state is around 1500 to 1600 metric tonnes, and there are no signs of any decline.
This is the case across India as there is a relentless demand for oxygen and it has gone beyond supply.
Generally about 15 percent of the oxygen supply is used for healthcare, and the rest is sent for industrial use.
 But at present, about 90 per cent of India's oxygen supply - 7,500 metric tonnes per day - is sent for medical use, says senior health official Rajesh Bhushan. 
When the first wave of the corona virus reached its peak in mid-September last year, the current demand is many times higher than the 2,700 metric tons of oxygen used daily.
Last year, about 90,000 new patients were found in India every day.
 When Shruti was admitted to the hospital in early April this year, the number of new patients in a single day was around 144,000. 
In two weeks, the daily number of new patients has doubled to over three lakh.
This has put a strain on India's fragile healthcare system and has led to its collapse.
Earlier this week, several major hospitals in Delhi were running out of oxygen - the Chief Minister had to make a public request and the High Court issued stern instructions.
The central government then made arrangements to recharge the oxygen late at night.
In Uttar Pradesh, some hospitals have put up 'Oxygen depletion' signs and two hospitals in Lucknow have asked patients to move elsewhere for fear of oxygen shortages.
Anxious relatives are queuing outside oxygen recharge centers in several cities. 
Special security guards have been deployed at a center in Hyderabad to control the crowd.
The Supreme Court has directed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's central government to come up with a national covid plan to address the oxygen shortage.
'No one knows when it will end'
The central government has been criticized for exacerbating the situation by not allowing election campaigns, Kumbh Mela and other programs to speed up the vaccination campaign. 
Critics say the government has not done much to deal with the second wave.
In October last year - eight months after the launch of the corona in India - the Ministry of Health invited tenders for new oxygen generating projects. 
Of these, 162 manufacturing centers have been approved, out of which only 33 have started work.
 59 centers will start by the end of April and 80 centers by the end of May, the ministry said.
But given the growing number of patients, officials are skeptical about whether this oxygen supply will be adequate. 
In Maharashtra, for example, oxygen production capacity was increased after the first wave, but even the hospitals ready for it are finding it difficult to cope with the deteriorating situation.
Generally, hospitals like ours have adequate oxygen supply.
But in the last fortnight, it has become a huge challenge to keep people breathing.
Even 22-year-old patients have to be supplied with oxygen from outside.
I don't think the government had any idea."
Although oxygen tanks have been installed in many district government hospitals in the state, there is a huge demand for oxygen in small towns and private hospitals.
People are reluctant to go to government hospitals, but these hospitals have a good supply of oxygen, which is likely to save lives," he said. 
Siddheshwar said.
So now the states are setting up new oxygen generating projects or trying to get oxygen from other states.
 And the central government is considering importing 50,000 metric tonnes of liquid oxygen.
 Every supplier is constantly working.
Ganesh Bharatiya, who runs an oxygen recharge center in Nanded, says, "We used to sell 150 to 200 cylinders a day, mostly in the industrial sector.
Now the demand has increased to 500 to 600 cylinders.
They say that even if you work 10-12 hours a day, you can somehow meet the demand.
"There is a slight improvement now, but no one has any idea when it will all end," he said. 
Siddheshwar says.
So doctors are using oxygen as carefully as possible.
"Oxygen supply is very important, but it needs to be streamlined," said Mumbai-based infectious disease specialist Dr. Says Om Srivastava.
But in the current situation, he says, it is impossible to predict how much oxygen a patient will need.
"Not every patient needs a certain amount of oxygen for a certain period of time.
The number of patients in a hospital needs oxygen varies from hour to hour.
The health of a paralyzed patient can suddenly become critical."
The rapid growth in demand for oxygen-powered beds is staggering - they say the demand has grown by almost 50 per cent in just a few weeks.
"We care as much as we can.
But I've never seen anything like it before.
In fact, no one here has ever experienced anything like it."
It is important to note that states like Kerala have increased their oxygen production capacity and are sending extra oxygen to other places, but in places like Delhi, most of the oxygen supply comes from outside.
Problems of distribution as well as supply
While supply is increasing in the states, distribution is also a challenge.
According to the head of one of the largest oxygen suppliers in India, it is a challenge to bring oxygen from eastern India (industrial states like Odisha and Jharkhand have high oxygen supply) to rapidly growing patients in western or northern India (Maharashtra or Delhi).
The pale blue and extremely cold liquid oxygen is at a temperature of 183 degrees. 
As it is a low temperature gas, it has to be stored in special cylinders and tankers for transportation.
About 500 factories in India purify oxygen from the air and supply it to hospitals in liquid form. 
Most of this supply is through tankers. 
Larger hospitals often have their own tanks, where oxygen is stored and then piped directly to patients' beds. 
Small and seasonal hospitals rely on steel and aluminum cylinders.
Oxygen tankers often line up outside projects for hours, and it takes about two hours to fill a tanker. 
Then these tankers take many more hours to reach different cities in different states. 
These tankers have to maintain some speed limit - maximum 40 kilometers per hour. 
Moreover, these tankers do not usually travel at night to avoid accidents.
In some places, oxygen tankers are preferred to ambulances to get out of traffic jams. 
But still it takes 15 to 25 hours for a tanker to reach small towns from big cities.
Increasing the supply and distribution of oxygen requires not only more capital expenditure but also more skilled manpower, a government official said on condition of anonymity.
"Many of the staff at these projects, and even in hospitals, lack these skills, and we're working to prevent leaks and reduce waste."
But oxygen suppliers also point to a lack of political will and readiness.
"We want to increase our capacity, but we will need financial support," said Rajabhai Shinde, who runs a small oxygen production project in Maharashtra.
"But no one said anything about it and now all of a sudden hospitals and doctors are demanding more and more cylinders.
This could have been avoided."
They say that once some health problem arises and they have difficulty getting oxygen, they start an oxygen production project.
"Well, you should dig a well before you get thirsty.
But you didn't do that."
Corona vaccine: Free vaccination for all in Maharashtra, state government decides
In Maharashtra, free vaccination will be given to all above 18 years of age. 
A global tender will be issued to make the vaccine available at cheaper rates and better.
Nawab Malik, National Spokesperson of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Minister for Minorities, said that the free vaccination program would be taken up from the state government's coffers.
The central government has announced a decision to vaccinate people above the age of 18 across the country from May one.
"Covidshield will cost Rs 150 for the center, Rs 400 for the state and Rs 600 for the private sector.
The price of covacin has also been announced at Rs 600 for the states and Rs 1,200 for the private sector," Malik said.
"The rate was discussed in the previous cabinet.
It was unanimously decided to give free vaccines to the people of the state.
Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had given his nod.
Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar announced it yesterday (April 24)," Malik said.
Earlier, more than 15 states in India announced free vaccination.
Corona: Why is the Narendra Modi government failing to supply oxygen?
There is a huge shortage of oxygen in many parts of the country, including the capital Delhi. 
This condition is seen to have serious effects on critically ill patients.
At least 20 people died at Jaipur Golden Hospital in Delhi on Friday night (April 24) due to lack of oxygen.
Private hospitals like Saroj and Fortis, along with government hospitals like LNJP, also lack oxygen. 
Some helpless hospitals have also taken the matter to court.
Similarly, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh are experiencing severe shortage of medical oxygen.
In Uttar Pradesh, some hospitals have boarded out oxygen out of stock boards.
Some hospitals in Lucknow informed patients about arrangements elsewhere. 
Delhi's small and big hospitals, nursing homes are also seen giving similar instructions.
In many cities, relatives of patients are seen fetching oxygen on their own.
 There are long, long queues for oxygen refilling.
At an oxygen factory in Hyderabad, the crowd grew so large that bouncers had to be called in to control it.
A few days ago, 22 people died due to oxygen leakage in Zakir Hussain Hospital in Nashik.
The accident happened while the tanker was being filled with oxygen.
 Oxygen supply was disrupted for half an hour due to oxygen leakage.
Coronary artery disease patients are free to wait for treatment.
 Hospitals have to work day and night to treat patients with respiratory obstruction.
Fortunately, doctors are working day and night to save the lives of those who have been bedridden.
There will be many posts on social media demanding oxygen cylinders.
But what caused this situation in the country in terms of oxygen? 
Why is it time to increase the demand for oxygen?
What causes oxygen shortages in many states?
Oxygen shortages are well planned by some states. 
Kerala had initially started increasing its oxygen supply.
 He also started keeping an eye on it.
Kerala increased oxygen as the patient began to grow. 
At present Kerala has more oxygen than it needs. 
They are also supplying oxygen to other states.
But Delhi and some other states do not have their own oxygen plants.
 They depend on other states for supplies.
Maharashtra has the highest incidence of corona in the country. 
Maharashtra alone accounts for one third of the total coronary artery disease in the country.
Currently, the state is producing 1200 metric tonnes of oxygen per day. 
But considering the number of patients, this number is not enough. 
The demand for oxygen is increasing day by day. 
Currently 1500 to 1600 metric tons of oxygen is required per day.
Dr. who runs Covid Hospital in Pune. 
"Normally, hospitals like ours get oxygen supply, but there have been special problems over the last two weeks.
Even 22-year-olds need oxygen support," he says.
According to doctors and accompanying pathologists, the number of corona patients is rapidly increasing and they have to wait for tests and treatment. 
As a result, people's health is deteriorating. 
He has to be hospitalized for treatment.
People are hospitalized when the situation becomes serious. 
These patients require high-flow oxygen. 
This has also increased the demand for oxygen. 
There is a greater need for oxygen this year than last year.
Dr. "No one knows when it will end.
I think the government may not have imagined the situation," says Shinde.
How difficult is it to get oxygen to the desired place?
According to experts, it is not a problem of producing oxygen in India, it is a problem of getting it to the right place on time.
Siddharth Jain, Director, Inox Air Products, spoke to BBC correspondent Vineet Khare.
He says, "Medical oxygen production capacity in India was 6500 MT.
It has been increased to 7200 MT per day.
According to Jain, India needed 700 metric tonnes of oxygen per day. 
It is currently 5,000 metric tons per day.
Saket Tiku of the All India Gases Manufacturers Association says, "On the one hand, there is a severe shortage of medical oxygen in Maharashtra.
On the other hand, there is a shortage of oxygen in the factories at Rourkela, Haldia in eastern India."
Special tankers are needed to transport medical oxygen from one place to another. 
This tanker is called a cryogenic tanker.
The medical oxygen is filled in a liquid in the cylinder. 
It is also loaded into cryogenic tankers.
It takes two hours to fill an oxygen tanker. 
So there are long, long queues of tankers outside the factories.
Apart from that, it takes time for these tankers to reach different cities and districts in different states. 
It takes several hours. 
In addition, these tankers have been given a speed limit to run on the road.
These tankers cannot run faster than 40 km per hour. 
The tanker is not operated even at night for fear of accidents.
Allegations transplanted into two states and state-center
Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has alleged that oxygen tankers coming to Delhi are being blocked by other states.
The Delhi government has accused the central government of not providing enough oxygen.
In the issue of oxygen shortage in Delhi's hospitals, Union Health Minister Dr. Harshvardhan said, "They have been given quotas as per the demand of the Delhi government.
It is up to them how they use them.
According to ANI, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan made the statement while on a visit to Sardar Patel Covid Care Center Hospital. 
This special hospital has been set up for Covid-19.
 It will start from next week.
Meanwhile, Dr. Harshvardhan said, "Every state in India has been given its share of oxygen in terms of oxygen production.
Delhi has also been given more oxygen than its demand.
Chief Minister Kejriwal had also thanked Prime Minister Modi for this."
The Delhi government now needs to plan for the proper use of oxygen. 
The central government has assured Delhi that there will be no disruption in oxygen supply.
Meanwhile, hospitals in Delhi have also approached the High Court in this regard. 
Even there, the Delhi government made the same argument while presenting its case.
What did the court say?
High courts in northern states, including Delhi and Maharashtra, have slammed the state governments concerned.
 He has directed the state government to bring the situation under control.
The Delhi High Court had on Saturday (April 24) warned that any official from the central, state or local administration who obstructed the supply of oxygen would be hanged.
The Maharaja Agrasen Hospital in Delhi had rushed to the high court as it was experiencing a lack of oxygen for critically ill Corona patients. 
The court made the above statement while hearing the petition.
A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said, "We will not let anyone interfere with the supply of oxygen.
" During the hearing, the court also slammed the central government.
"You had promised on April 21 that 480 metric tonnes of oxygen would be supplied to Delhi every day.
But when will this happen?" That's what the court asked.
How is oxygen produced?
Liquid oxygen is light blue in color and very cold.
 It is a cryogenic gas. 
Its temperature is minus 183 degrees. 
This oxygen can only be transported through specially made cylinders and tankers.
Oxygen is extracted and purified from about 500 factories in India.
It is then converted into a liquid and sent to hospitals. 
Most of the oxygen is supplied from tankers.
Larger hospitals have their own tankers. 
It is filled with oxygen. 
This oxygen then finally reaches the patient. 
Small hospitals use steel or aluminum cylinders.
Did the government try to increase production?
The Union Health Ministry had held an auction in October last year to start the oxygen plant.
Several proposals were received for this. 
Of these, 162 proposals were approved. 
But so far only 33 plants have been able to start. 
Another 59 plants will be up and running by the end of April. 
The remaining 80 plants are expected to be commissioned in May.
What steps is the government taking now?
The central government has decided to import medical oxygen from abroad in view of the shortage of oxygen in the country and the severity of corona infection.
On Saturday, the central government decided to waive customs duty and health tax on imports of oxygen and related equipment for the next three months.
Efforts are being made to import 50,000 metric tonnes of oxygen.
The government's Empowered Group has imposed restrictions on the use of oxygen by all industries except nine.
In addition, the government has allocated funds to build 162 PSA medical oxygen plants.
Rajiv Gupta of Vinayak Air Products Pvt Ltd told the BBC's Vineet Khare: "The oxygen content of the plant is 92-93 per cent.
So it can run.
It has a capacity of one to two metric tonnes.
Apart from this, the government is also running Oxygen Express Railway for fast oxygen supply. 
The air force is being called in to help the empty tankers reach the plant.
Why do patients with covidosis need oxygen?
We are taking oxygen in the air through our nostrils. 
Oxygen is absorbed into the bloodstream through your lungs. 
Next it has a chemical reaction with glucose in your blood vessels.
That is, energy is generated from food. 
This is a very important process for any animal. 
The problem of oxygen mixing with the bloodstream is also disrupted if there is a problem with lung function. 
In such cases, the oxygen we get through breathing is insufficient. 
Such patients need to be given pure oxygen.
Oxygen concentrators are sometimes used for this purpose. 
This machine takes oxygen from the air, purifies it and supplies it to the patient.
 It is easy to use. 
But experts say it is not enough to give corona patients oxygen in such a way.
Corona patients have to be given oxygen through cylinders and pipes. 
No further details have been released. 
The doctor decides whether to give the corona oxygen to the patient by machine or by cylinder.
The Food and Drug Administration of the Government of Maharashtra is seeking more information. 
The oxygen concentrator is being used to determine whether covid patients are being helped.
Patients in the shadow of the corona, desperate relatives and strange silence - ground report
There was no oxygen, no beds in the hospitals, no medicine and no ventilators, no lockdown, so I decided to go to the place where the workers were going and get in the car.
I visited many hospitals, went to a bus stand and even went to a train station.
Another vehicle was seen on the road. 
The ambulance was speeding away, sounding a loud siren on the side of my car. 
The sound of their sirens echoed in my ears from afar.
Delhi with a population of two crore is the capital of the country. 
Saturday is a holiday. 
But Corona kept the atmosphere in awe. 
Shops and malls are closed. 
There were a lot of people out there who needed a pass.
The lockdown was imposed last Saturday-Sunday in Delhi. 
The lockdown was extended for a week on Monday. 
On Sunday, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal indicated that the lockdown would be effective till May 3.
Status of hospitals
This was the scene outside many hospitals in the capital. 
The relatives of the patient are trying to keep his breathing smooth. 
Their relentless struggle to get oxygen continues.
 Fonafoni is on for that. 
They are begging the hospital authorities.
I reached the gate of a hospital, where it was written on the barricade that 'there are no beds available'.
Sick people and their relatives had compassion on their faces. 
I could understand their discomfort.
 There were many neighbors and true friends.
I then felt that the government was almost gone in these difficult times. 
At that time, brotherhood is seen among the people. 
Humanity is alive.
What about Muslims, what about Hindus, what about the rich, what about the poor.
 Everyone is helping each other.
Caring for relatives of patients
I arrived at AIIMS Hospital here.
 It is one of the leading hospitals in the country. 
Patients come here from all over the country.
The premises of this hospital are so big that if you don't know exactly where to go inside, you can lose. 
People of any class, rich or poor, are treated here.
I was allowed to go to Covid Ward and I didn't want to.
 I knew there were good treatments for corona here.
My brother was in the same hospital for twelve days after being infected with corona last year. 
When the brother was recruited, AIIMS director Randeep Guleria said, "Your chances of surviving are fifty per cent." 
But still the brother recovered and came out.
When I arrived at the AIIMS on Saturday, there were a lot of people outside the Coved Ward. 
Most came from outside Delhi. 
He was a financially weak man. 
Many had laid their beds on the sidewalk. 
Some of them were cooking there.
Hospitals also desperate
While talking to people standing outside the AIIMS, I came to know that 20 people had died due to irregular supply of oxygen at Jaipur Golden Hospital. 
Three days ago, 25 people died at Sir Gangaram Hospital due to the same cause.
I reached Jaipur Golden Hospital from AIIMS. 
Two and a half hundred critically ill patients were admitted here. 
They were supplied with oxygen.
Hospital staff said oxygen levels began to drop after midnight and there was a commotion everywhere.
I talked to Richa Avastha. 
She was there with her husband. 
She looked annoyed at the hospital officials.
He said that Jethani was among those who had crossed the border. 
Seema Awasthi was the headmaster of a school in the same area. 
Jethani's children were getting married. 
Our society has lost a good personality.
He said that he had talked to Seema on WhatsApp the night before. 
Later I also came to the hospital. 
They were not allowed to enter the Covid ward. 
But from his WhatsApp, it was clear that his condition was improving.
He blamed hospital officials for Seema's death.
 This is because the hospital officials did not say that the oxygen supply was reduced.
I met another man whose two elder brothers were admitted to Jaipur Golden Hospital. 
The condition of both is fine now. 
With the help of friends, he had an oxygen cylinder ready in the car.
That cylinder was used by his friend's father at home. 
He also had corona but his condition was not serious. 
So on Saturday at eleven o'clock a call came from the hospital that the oxygen had run out. 
When they were told to arrange oxygen for their brothers, they started running with the cylinder.
He became emotional while talking to me. 
Only he who is under the influence of time knows what is happening.
They thanked God that they were able to get both brothers out of trouble. 
They did not need an oxygen cylinder because at the same time an oxygen tanker arrived at the hospital.
The tanker was brought under heavy police security. 
The tanker entered the hospital premises and people cheered spontaneously. 
Hospital staff, including relatives of the patients, breathed a sigh of relief.
The crisis was averted for two days at a hospital. 
But the same crisis persisted in other hospitals.
Oxygen supply to most hospitals in Delhi has been reduced in the last few days. 
But the condition of large hospitals is even worse.
While I was at the Jaipur Golden Hospital, news came that the oxygen supply to the hospital at Shalimar Bagh would be cut off in two to three hours.
I got there. 
The security guards forbade me to go inside. 
I contacted the hospital authorities by phone. 
The Center is blaming Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and private hospitals for managing oxygen.
 That is why the hospital administration is staying away from the media.
He said that oxygen has been provided in Noida and the tanker has left Noida. 
I was there for an hour but the tanker didn't reach anything. 
Shortly afterwards, officials said the tanker had arrived.
Loyalty to the doctor
From Sir Gangaram Hospital to AIIMS, one thing I noticed was the lack of oxygen. 
There is a shortage of beds and ventilators. 
But the repression of doctors, nurses and other staff working in the hospital has not abated.
There is a small garden in front of Gangaram Hospital. 
It is in the hospital premises. 
The congregation working at the hospital was sitting there talking.
Two women wearing PPE kits were eating with a box on the grass.
 She was going to the ward as soon as she ate.
He said that he has been working without any break for the last ten days. 
We are doing this on our own, she said. 
They are working overtime for certain hours every day.
We are ready for the corona infection to spread further.
 Because people are going to need a doctor.
Some women were sitting in front of the reception of Jaipur Golden Hospital. 
One of them was crying. 
She seemed very upset. 
At the reception I asked why no one is paying attention to them?
 I was told that there were no beds available in the hospital.
They have been told about it. 
They don't know where to go now, so they just sit there hoping the bed will be empty.
Migrant workers began to return home
The lockdown was imposed as corona infection was on the rise in Delhi. 
Due to lack of manual labor, the migrant workers marched towards the village again.
 Most of the workers are returning to the village from Anand Vihar bus terminal.
You must have seen the photos of the crowd gathered there. 
The workers who came there with their luggage said that they have got ten days leave. 
So they are going to the village.
The building that was under construction is stalled.
There was also a lot of crowd outside the Anand Vihar railway station. 
Some of the coaches have been converted into coveted coaches.
 It says in big letters that it is forbidden to go inside.
After visiting various hospitals throughout the day, I realized that there is a strange peace in Delhi.
The shop has cooled the market. 
There are no cars on the road, no people.
 Curfew is being observed but people are scared.
 The expression of fear is clearly visible on the faces of the people.
Police and paramilitary forces are deployed on roads and hospitals. 
But there is an invisible fear in the atmosphere that a gun can do nothing.
Iraq: 82 killed, including coroners, in hospital oxygen tank explosion
A fire at a hospital in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, has killed at least 82 people. 
The deaths also included corona patients.
More than 100 people were injured in the crash. 
The incident took place at Al Khatib Hospital in Baghdad.
According to local reports, the fire broke out when the oxygen tank in the hospital burst.
Videos shared on social media show that there was a commotion among the people after the fire broke out and they were running from place to place. 
Firefighters are also seen in the video extinguishing the fire.
Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Qadimi has called the incident "unfortunate" and ordered an investigation.
After the fire broke out, relatives started rushing to find their patients.
A man named Ahmed Zaki had come there to save his ailing brother.
 He told about the fire incident. 
Also, they have saved some patients.
He said, "Initially there was an explosion.
Another explosion came from the other side.
The fire was spreading like fuel.
The smoke reached my brother.
My brother is sick.
I took him on the road.
Then I went back.
The fire did not reach the last floor.
I saw a year old girl suffocating.
She would have died.
I carried her on my shoulders and carried her out.
People were jumping around.
Doctors were falling on the roofs of cars.
I went up again and brought people down. "
The fire started from the hospital's intensive care unit, Major General Kadim Bohan, the head of Iraq's civil defense department, told state media.
Some patients died due to the machine being pulled out of the hospital while others died due to suffocation.
Corona outbreak began in Iraq in February.
 So far, more than one million corona patients have been registered in the country.
According to the Iraqi Ministry of Health, more than one million people in the country have been infected with the corona so far.
 15,217 patients have died.
Iraq launched the corona vaccine last month and so far 6.5 million people in the country have been vaccinated.
Corona Vaccine: Can you get corona vaccine during menstruation?
From May 1, 2021, all people over the age of 18 will be vaccinated against corona. 
But before that, a message about menstruation was circulating and many people started asking questions about it. 
Many are confused. 
Seeing this, we asked the experts whether to get vaccinated during menstruation or not and got scientific information.
But did this question arise? So read this message circulating on social media - " Vaccination is starting for everyone over the age of 18 from a date.
When registering for vaccination, keep an eye on when menstruation occurs.
Do not get vaccinated five days before and five days after menstruation.
The immune system is weakened.
The first dose of the vaccine lowers your immune system and then gradually boosts your immune system.
So do not get vaccinated during menstruation. "
Over the last few days, this and similar messages have been circulating on WhatsApp as well as other messaging apps.
According to the new policy of the central government, all persons above the age of 18 years will be vaccinated. 
Registration will start for that.
In the first phase, doctors, nurses and medical staff were vaccinated.
 The senior citizens were then vaccinated. 
Vaccination was then opened to people over the age of 45.
Under the new policy, men and women between the ages of 18 and 45 will now be able to get vaccinated. 
After the announcement of this decision, messages saying don't get vaccinated during menstruation started circulating on social media.
'The vaccine does not harm your body'
Does Vaccination Affect Menstruation? Or we talked to Dr. Gayatri Deshpande about whether experts really say that you should not get vaccinated due to low immunity during menstruation.
Dr. Gayatri Deshpande is a Senior Consultant in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Nanavati Super Specialty Hospital.
Dr. Deshpande says, "Menstruation is a natural thing.
There should be no hindrance.
Get vaccinated whenever you have time.
Young girls will be out of the house for work because not everyone can work from home.
Many women work in essential services.
Menstruation may or may not start at any time.
They must be vaccinated if they are registered and receiving the vaccine. "
There is no fear that the vaccine will harm your body, said Dr. Gayatri Deshpande says.
What is the explanation given by the Government of India?
The Press Information Bureau issued a fact check after messages about menstruation and vaccination started circulating on social media.
It says that girls and women are being told not to get vaccinated five days before and five days after menstruation. 
Those messages are fake. 
Don't believe the rumors.
The vaccination campaign for everyone over the age of 18 is starting from 1st May. 
Registration for this is starting from April 28 on cowin.gov.in .
Does corona affect menstruation? BBC Marathi had earlier sought information from doctors in this regard.
Covid can change the menstrual cycle?
About 40 per cent of the total number of coronary patients in Maharashtra are women. 
So we tried to find out from gynecologists, does covid change women's menstrual cycle?
Speaking to the BBC, Fortis Hospital gynecologist Dr. Sonal Kumta says, "Complaints of irregular menstruation, late menstruation, change in bleeding pattern, excessive bleeding have been found in women who have been discharged from the corona."
According to experts, patients with coronary heart disease show other medical problems. 
So did Kovid change the shift? It is not possible to say for sure.
Speaking to the BBC about this, the former head of the gynecology department of Sir JJ Hospital, Dr. Ashok Anand says, "There are documented reports of swelling of the ovaries in women after covid.
These cases have been reported."
"If the ovaries are swollen after a corona infection, there is a chance of discomfort or changes during menstruation," said Dr. Happiness continues.
What is 'amenorrhea'?
According to Web-MD, 'amenorrhea' means no menstruation.
 If a woman has this problem, she will not have menstruation.
 This is not a disease.
 But, doctors should be informed about this.
Corona and menstruation?
Experts say there is no concrete evidence that corona has a direct effect on the menstrual cycle.
The gynecologist of Hiranandani Hospital, Dr. Manjiri Mehta says, "Menstrual changes cannot be directly linked to Covid-19.
There is still no evidence to show that corona infection affects menstruation."
Mumbai-based gynecologist Dr. No woman has come to Komal Chavan complaining of menstrual problems after he was released from the corona.
Speaking to the BBC, she said: "After a long-term illness, women's menstrual periods change.
Some have more or less bleeding.
"But it needs to be studied," he said. 
Komal has an opinion.
Changes in the female reproductive system after covid?
Corona infection weakens the body's immune system. 
Some suffer from lung problems.
 So, in some, other medical problems arise.
"Decreased immunity after covid is likely to weaken the reproductive system."
That's what Dr. Fortis Hospital. 
Sonal Kumta says.
What should women do?
According to gynecologists, women should take care of themselves.
Proper diet, exercise is essential
The body should relax at the right time
Sleep should be on time
Don't sit and work too long.
 Take a break from work.
After the Covid-19 infection, the body gradually recovers. 
So the menstrual cycle will gradually return to normal, said Dr. Says Kumta.
Did women have menstrual problems in the lockdown?
Dr. Manjiri adds, "Women with PCOD (Polycystic Ovarian Disease) did not exercise during the lockdown.
Eating and drinking times changed as they worked from home.
Eating more junk food increased the risk of weight gain.
Corona: 20 covid positive patients passed through the isolation center
Twenty corona positive patients have escaped from the isolation center ITI College, an industrial training institute at Ghatanji in Yavatmal district. 
All of them were admitted to the center at around 8.30 am yesterday after testing positive for corona.
These people will be brought back to the center, said Health Officer Dharmesh Chavan.
"The fugitives are villagers.
They may have returned from the center out of fear or because they feel nothing has happened.
We will bring them back tomorrow," said Dharmesh Chavan, taluka health officer of Ghatanji taluka.
Around noon on April 24, 20 patients were discharged from the isolation ward. 
It is learned that 65 Corona patients were admitted to the Industrial Training Institute at Ghatanji. 
Of those, 20 corona patients are known to have escaped.
Finding out how many people they have met in the meantime will also be a big headache for the administration.
Corona virus: How will this 'make the chain' break?
About one o'clock in the afternoon.
 In the scorching sun, a Maruti Omni Ambulance came to a halt at the door of the hospital. 
Four or five young men jumped out of it and began searching for a doctor at the hospital.
A very serious patient was in that car. 
He seemed to be having trouble breathing. 
Moments later the doctor examined him and advised him to be taken to the next major hospital. 
The next minute the whole congregation got in the car and moved on.
This is a daily routine for the staff of Covid Hospital.
They don't feel it anymore. 
 Most of them have taken both vaccines.
 But for a man like me, that picture was new.
On the one hand, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and his entire government are saying 'break the chain - break the chain'. 
For this, ninth rules are being issued every day and on the other hand, a picture of 'Make the Chain' is being formed against it.
I have to go to Covid Hospital every day for the treatment of my family members. 
But seeing the picture there creates fear in the mind. 
At least 3 relatives are following them to admit a patient.
The whole family had come to see a grandfather in the hospital.
 Not all well-to-do relatives follow Covid's rules. 
Often these stressful relatives do not realize that we are with a patient who has covid or its symptoms.
Isn't it necessary for relatives to come? If asked, the answer is no. 
The reason is that if a patient is admitted and his condition is serious, then at least 3 relatives have to run after him. 
He has the same reasons.
1) Finding Remedicivir (Although it is supplied directly to hospitals, it is insufficient.)
2) Facilitate Plasma (For this, at least 2 donors have to be found and taken to the Plasma Bank.)
3) If the hospital runs out of oxygen by mistake, rush to find an oxygen concentrator.
4) Purchase of daily necessities and other necessities.
These are unavoidable reasons. 
And getting all of this is a test for the patient's relatives. 
It takes an exact amount of money, time and effort to pass this test. 
But the biggest test is the doctors, nurses and other staff working in the hospital.
The patients and their relatives are cared for by their noses. 
This is the subject of a separate article.
 This stressful congregation is often unable to go with each patient for other checkups.
In such cases, the relatives of the patients have to take their patients. 
Even with the idea that you are going with a covid patient, many have no cure.
This is the same group of relatives who take patients to the hospital, help them, sometimes visit patients in the ICU without the doctor's notice (yes it is true).
Young relatives meet other friends without ever wearing a mask in the hope that nothing will happen to them.
 Go to the nose and chat with friends.
We don't think we've been exposed to the corona in a lot of places, or we don't have the seriousness of it.
Strict lockdown was imposed during the first wave of the corona. 
At that time, people were following the rules for fear of the police. 
Now there is strong opposition to the strict lockdown from different levels.
As a result, the government also avoided a strict lockdown. 
But how much do the working class or the merchant class and the traders who oppose this lockdown follow the rules laid down by the government?
Still some vendors, merchants or working class are unconcerned about masks. 
People also seem unconcerned about masks, sanitizers, proper distance.
The government has allowed the shops to continue till a certain time, but the shops are being kept open till the municipal vehicle arrives to close the shops. 
When the municipal vehicle arrives, the peddlers start running away.
On the one hand, the number of new corona patients in the state is approaching 50,000 every day. 
There are queues of patients in every small hospital.
Medical shops are getting crowded to take medicines. 
Everyone in the acquaintance or relationship has died of cowardice or someone is very serious. 
Everyone talks about it.
And on the other hand, this is the picture.
Fear of the corona seems to be waning in people's minds. 
The people in the buildings where Corona's patient was found in the first wave were overwhelmed.
Now, however, citizens are seen living in the buildings where Corona's patients were found. 
In societies, 50 per cent of men and women who go out for night raids do not wear a mask. 
The ones that are planted are under the nose.
Well these churches are watching the news on TV every day about how serious the situation has become. 
The words break the chain, break the chain are somehow falling on their ears.
Many such examples and observations can be given. 
But the need is not to frighten Corona, but to take her seriously.
Mann Ki Baat-Narendra Modi: 'Corona is testing the patience of all of us'
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Mann Ki Baat program for the month of April will be telecast today. 
A second wave of corona is sweeping across the country.
More than 3 lakh corona patients are found in the country every day. 
The current picture is that the stress of this situation is coming on the health system.
There are reports of shortages of oxygen, beds, ventilators and remedicivir from all parts of the country.
Against this backdrop, it is important to see what issues Narendra Modi discusses in this year's Mann Ki Baat.
Narendra Modi had said at the time that lockdown should be the last resort.
Last week, on April 20, Narendra Modi addressed the nation. 
Meanwhile, Modi also appealed that Kumbh Mela should be celebrated in a formal manner on the backdrop of Corona. 
He also canceled his visit to West Bengal and held a meeting with the Chief Minister.
Seeing all these developments, everyone is paying attention to Narendra Modi's mind.
Significance depends on the size of the problem
Corona is watching your test. 
Your men have left prematurely. 
In the first wave we defeated Corona.
 But in the second wave, he is bothering us.
I had discussions with experts in various fields. 
He made several suggestions.
 Various state governments, including the Center, are contributing. 
Health workers are fighting tirelessly.
Dr. What did Shashank Joshi say?
Member of Maharashtra Task Force Dr. Mann Ki Baat. Shashank Joshi interacted with the Prime Minister. 
The second wave is fast approaching.
Mortality is low.
Young children are also showing symptoms.
Taste and odor are also symptoms.
Eighty percent of people have no symptoms at all.
Mutations occur.
As we change clothes, the virus takes on a different form, he said.
Mild symptoms, moderate to severe symptoms. 
Check for fever, oxygen and pulse for mild symptoms. 
Paracetamol should be taken on the advice of a doctor. 
Consult a doctor for moderate symptoms.  
There are small solutions.
Remedesivir is an experimental drug.
This can reduce hospital stay. 
This medicine is only for those who need oxygen. 
Pranayama, lung exercises can help. 
The best treatments in the world are available in the country. 
The recovery rate is good.

4. Nine thousand metric tons of oxygen sent abroad - Chhagan Bhujbal
There is a shortage of oxygen in the country and many hospitals are dying due to lack of oxygen. 
Despite this situation, Food and Civil Supplies Minister Chhagan Bhujbal has alleged that 9,000 metric tonnes of oxygen was sent abroad from the country.
Oxygen deficiency is present in all the states.
Many coronary heart disease patients have lost their lives due to lack of oxygen. 
 In such a case, if oxygen is being sent abroad from here, then the matter is serious.

Corona virus: Why is it necessary to take care even after recovering from covid?
So far, millions of people in India have successfully overcome Kovid-19.
 People have conquered corona on the strength of timely diagnosis, medication and positive attitude.
After winning the battle against Covid-19, the real battle begins to unleash life. 
To rise again with new hope. 
That is why it is important to maintain good mental health along with physical health.
There has been an increase in cases of lung injury in patients who have been deprived of corona for a longer period of time on oxygen and ventilators. 
These patients have started having problems like shortness of breath and shortness of breath. 
Therefore, some covid-free patients in Mumbai had to be put on oxygen again.
According to doctors, getting rid of corona does not mean that you cannot be careless. 
Coronation survivors should take special care of themselves.
What should covid-free patients take care of?
According to the World Health Organization, it is normal to experience shortness of breath and loss of strength due to illness. 
This makes it very difficult to breathe.
So the following things need to be done-
1) Sleep on the left side while sleeping. 
Take a pillow under the head to support the head and neck. 
The legs should be slightly bent at the knees.
2) If you have difficulty breathing while sitting at the table, bend forward from the waist and place your head and neck on the pillow placed on the table. 
Hands should be placed comfortably on the table. 
Even if you don't take a pillow, it will work.
3) In case of discomfort while sitting on a chair, bend forward a little and place your hands on your thighs
How to breathe?
Sit quietly in one place. 
Keep one hand on the chest and the other on the abdomen, close the eyes and sit quietly. 
Inhale slowly through the nose and release through the mouth. 
If nasal breathing is obstructed, breathe through the mouth. 
Try to breathe as slowly as possible.
Exercises to do after coming home from the hospital
Exercise reduces the difficulty in breathing. 
Helps to strengthen muscles. 
Reduces stress. 
Confidence grows. 
If you are on oxygen in the hospital, keep someone with you during exercise. 
Inform your doctor immediately if you experience any discomfort while exercising.
So Pay Exercise - Roll the shoulders back and forth. 
Slightly bend to the left and right while standing or sitting on a chair. 
Try to bend the legs at the knees. 
This is called 'warm up'.
A little hard exercise - try to walk in space. 
When walking outside, walk on a flat land. 
Gradually increase walking speed and distance.
Post-covid OPD in hospitals
Long-term exposure to oxygen and ventilators has increased the incidence of lung disease in patients who have been freed of Covid-19. 
Post-covid OPD has been started for such patients at KEM, Fortis, St. George and other hospitals in Mumbai.
Speaking to the BBC about what to take care of those who have been freed from covid, the General Physician of St. George's Hospital, Dr. Rahul Darnule says, "Corona virus reduces the efficiency of the lungs.
Therefore, breathing exercises, pranayama, short brisk walking are very important to increase the lung function of covid-free patients.
The incidence of lung scarring has increased in those who have been released from the corona. 
Therefore, rehabilitation program is very important for the patients who have lung injury after healing with corona. 
Rahul has an opinion.
"Post-covid OPD has been started at St. George's Hospital.
In this OPD, patients are called for follow-up and their chest is CT-scanned.
They are taught breathing exercises and patients are told to do these exercises daily after going home," he said. 
Rahul further said.
Even if the covid is released, it should not be left out
Speaking to the BBC, a chest and lung specialist from Mumbai's Zen Multispeciality Hospital, Dr. Arvind Kate said, "It is important to take care of covid-free patients even after they go home.
Coronum-free patients cannot rule out the possibility of re-infection.
In addition, you need to take vitamin-C tablets. "
"Drink hot water while eating.
Eat a nutritious diet.
Oxygen levels in the body should be checked regularly.
If you feel any discomfort, you should contact a doctor immediately," said Dr. Said Kate.
Covid-19 and results
Speaking to the BBC about the importance of rehabilitation for coroners, Dr. Rahul Pandit says, "Significant changes have been found in patients struggling with Kovid-19 such as intolerance to exercise stress, poor sleep schedule, muscle loss, and loss of appetite.
"It is very important to re-evaluate the existing disease.
What was the severity of the disease before covid-19 and what was the effect after covid-19?
It needs to be monitored. " 
Asam Dr. Pandit said.
How to get rid of stress, anxiety and depression
According to experts, even if the patient is free of covid, he is constantly scared. 
The stress of what society will say and how it will behave is very much on that person. 
Therefore, people should pay attention to mental health as well as physical health.
Talking to BBC about this, psychiatrist Dr. Sagar Mundada says, "Sometimes a covine-free patient is traumatized by the mistreatment of society.
There is a risk of anger.
Therefore, corona-free patients should think positively.
People should be mentally prepared for what they will say.
Post Covid Care is not very difficult if it is mental preparation. "
After Kovid, most of the patients are alone at home.
In such cases, thoughts come to their minds.
So people should do mindful meditation for 10 minutes.
It will not cause mental exhaustion.
Medications will help alleviate this anxiety, "said Dr. Called Mundada.
How to maintain good mental health?
According to the World Health Organization, managing post-illness stress, anxiety and depression is also an important step in recovering from an illness. For this,
Covid-free patients should get enough sleep.
 Eat a healthy, proper and nutritious diet. 
Stay active which helps in reducing stress. 
Talk to people, listen to songs to calm your mind, read.
Brain exercises should be done to help increase memory.
The importance of physiotherapy after covid
Covid-19 infection reduces the mobility of some individuals, especially the elderly. 
Physiotherapy is very important in the rehabilitation of such patients.
Talking to BBC about this, physiotherapist from Pune Dr. Mansi Pawar says, "Chest physiotherapy is very important for patients who have been on covid-19 for a long time.
These patients cannot exercise immediately after recovery due to poor mobility.
Chest physiotherapy helps to clear the lungs.
Physiotherapy gradually strengthens the muscles. "
"Therefore, Covid-19-free patients should do breathing exercises first.
Exercise should be started slowly after the lung function increases.
However, one should take someone with him or consult a doctor while exercising," said Dr. Says Mansi.
Corona: How are tired doctors working without sleeping in such an environment of screaming, screaming, hooting?
Diabetes doctor Rahul Bakshi was on a round of covid wards at the Bombay Hospital in July. 
Then they saw an employee wearing a PPE kit sitting in front of a table fan in a room. 
He must have been taking a break from his eight-hour Covid Ward duty.
Steroids prescribed for the treatment of covidia increase the amount of sugar in patients.
 Therefore, Dr. The role of a diabetes specialist like Bakshi is important for patients.
Doctors usually don't keep their phones with them during rounds of covid wards. 
So Dr. Bakshi picked up the phone of a junior doctor working in the nursing station and snapped a photo of a colleague resting in front of the fan.
PPE stands for Personal Protective Equipment N-95 Mask, Surgical Mask, Goggles, Face Shield, Gown, Cap.
Wearing a PPE kit means not eating, not drinking water. 
Can't go to natural rituals, can't take any help from anyone.
What if you were asked to work on a kit for a few months? What will happen to you
Fear of wearing a PPE kit
Dr. on Instagram account. Bakshi wrote under the photo, "I had to soak in sweat for half an hour after wearing the PPE kit because you are packed from head to toe.
The problems are even greater for doctors, nurses, ward helpers, lab assistants, radiology staff, cleaners and others moving from one ward to another.
If you walk a hundred meters wearing a PPE kit, you will catch your breath. 
It was difficult to breathe if I went up two floors. "
Dr. Bakshi writes, "When a man wears a PPE kit and sits in front of the fan, the fan makes a loud noise.
But its air does not reach us.
We do not know it even though there is strong wind outside.
Working in such a situation also has psychological consequences."
Over the past year, millions of doctors, medical staff have been dealing with the corona crisis in challenging situations.
Bhagyalakshmi, a resident doctor in Mumbai, says, "For the first time in my life, many people have to refuse because of the second wave of covid.
Patients' relatives are looking for ventilators and oxygen beds. "
Death of a doctor
According to official figures, the Corona crisis has so far killed 1.87 lakh people in the country. 
President and Professor of the Indian Medical Association Dr. J. A. According to Jayalal, 780 doctors have died of corona so far.
Corona does not count the number of deaths of nurses, medical professionals.
For the last thirteen months, doctors have been working in the medical field despite the problems at home, the increasing pressure of work, the constant deaths around, the fear.
Dr. Bhagyalakshmi says, "We have been working in a stressful environment for a long time.
We are frustrated."
Dr. Bhagyalakshmi often has to work for 10 hours with a PPE kit.
Depressing atmosphere
According to Suhail Nayak, a pediatrician in Baramulla, Kashmir, it is very difficult to work in such an environment. 
When there is so much mental oppression on you, there is a corona all around and only the corona, there is a situation where people cannot breathe.
According to Rohit Joshi, a resident doctor in Mumbai, it is frustrating to work in such an environment. 
Do you sometimes feel that way? Give up.
Resident doctors are on duty 24 hours a day as compared to senior doctors and consultants.
Working in the ward of Kovid patients wearing PPE kits for ten hours a day for many days, not being able to help people even if they want to, calling for duty at any time of the night, not getting enough sleep, stressful environment from morning to evening, working unhealthily, deaths all around, Working in an environment where crying, weeping, and weeping can be overwhelming.
Dr. Rohit Joshi says, "The number of patients is huge, the number of doctors is low.
We have to work fast.
One patient cannot be given more than fifteen to twenty minutes.
It is not just the number of covid patients that is increasing. 
People with covid negatives are sent to non-covid wards. 
The number of patients is increasing there as well. "
How long is all this?
In the second wave of covid, there is a shortage of oxygen, hospital beds, medicines, injections. 
The doctor's question is how long will all this last?
"If this continues, we will not be able to stay away from our families," said a female health worker who works away from her family in Bhagalpur, Bihar.
Citizens clapped and clapped for people working in the medical field. 
Doctors and congregations working in the medical field are urging people to wear masks, keep a distance and wash their hands regularly.
"We were risking our lives," says Amandeep Kaur, a gynecologist in Jammu. 
Now we are risking the lives of our families.
Amandeep's parents, who work at a government hospital in Gandhinagar, Jammu, are over 60 years old. 
His mother suffers from diabetes. 
So he has stopped visiting his mother.
Amandeep also had a corona during surgery on a woman who was infected with covid in August.
Dr. Amandeep says, "Ten covid positive patients underwent caesarean section in August.
Their children were negative.
That's when I came to believe that God is with us."
Jammu was the only hospital in Kovid to deliver positive women.
After each surgery she would take a bath and then move on to the next task.
People from Poonch, Rajouri, Kishtwar, Doda coming to their hospital. 
Amandeep used to perform two to three surgeries daily.
During the lockdown, she would drive to the hospital for surgery. 
The atmosphere at that time, the pressure of work, the distance from everyone after work all affected his little boy. 
Amandeep had to discuss with his teachers.
He also felt dizzy while undergoing surgery wearing a PPE kit. 
He said that he would sit for a while and then go back to work.
Adding PPE does not avert the danger
After applying the PPE kit, there is a sweat bath. 
Salt and water are excreted from the body. 
In such cases you cannot remove the mask.
Wearing a PPE kit does not mean that there is no danger. 
Amandeep and his colleagues have been corona.
Doctors and their colleagues in the Covid ward are working in an environment with a huge viral load.
Through coughing and sneezing, the virus accumulates in the air droplets and also travels to the PPE kit.
The outer part of the mask may contain the corona virus.
PPE is a method of kit removal. 
Gowns, goggles have to be removed in a certain order. 
This is because aerosols and particles stay in the same room when removing the PPE kit.
Dr. Amandeep's husband Dr. According to Sandeep Dogra, even after wearing a PPE kit in the first wave of corona, the doctors got corona because, after leaving the ward, they felt that nothing would happen now. 
You should not remove the mask in the room. 
This story was not known then. 
Now it is slowly beginning to be noticed.
Family worries
Given the rapid rate at which corona infections are spreading, doctors fear that their families may not be affected.
Motihari's surgeon Dr. Ashutosh Sharan says, "After coming out of the OPD, he removes the gloves by singing.
He sanitizes himself.
He takes a bath with hot water when he goes home.
Only then he meets his family."
Dr. Sharan has his own nursing home.
They have been vaccinated.
  However, your grandchildren and staff are very careful not to become corona.
The 65-year-old Sharan's day starts at nine in the morning and ends at ten at night.
He had gone to Siliguri only once in the last 13-14 months for his grandson’s birthday.
 This was possible because the number of corona patients had decreased in December and January.
Dr. Mumbai. Joshi thinks, "A lot of people have no idea what conditions doctors have to work in.
According to them, it is a matter of money for doctors to prescribe injections on remediation.
Or is it an attempt to boil down the money of Covid Hospital.
I can't change people.
But there are a lot of people who make us look good.
They give us courage and strength to work.
Maharashtra Corona: 'One person dies in our village every day for last 15 days'
"For the last 15 days, one person has been dying from corona in our village every day.
There are currently around 500 corona patients in the village." - Satish Ugle, Dodi Budruk
This is the situation at present in Dodi Budruk village in Sinnar taluka of Nashik district.
The second wave of corona has caused havoc in Maharashtra. 
The corona virus, which previously spread to urban areas, is now beginning to take over rural areas. 
The increasing number of corona patients in villages is indicative of this. 
This is a review of the situation in the rural areas of the state while there is a lot of discussion about the shortage of health services in Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur.
The number of corona patients in Dodi Budruk has been increasing rapidly for the last 15 days. 
But not only the number of patients but also the number of deaths has increased.
To curb this, the villagers of Dodi Budruk are planning to set up a covid care center in the village itself.
"Corona's death rate in our village is very high.
So we discussed the WhatsApp group and now the villagers are planning to set up a few-bed covid care center in the village.
But, doctors, nurses and others for this center.
There is a rural hospital in Dodi Budruk with a population of about 7,000. 
But the villagers complain that the facilities are not being provided as they are for the entire taluka.
As a result, corona positive patients are being quarantined in their own homes.
Fear of the hospital
When asked what is on the minds of the villagers about corona, Satish says, "Everyone knows that if you test corona and come back positive, you will not get a bed.
So you don't want to be tested and you have to take pains.
People are wondering where to get Rs 2 lakh from. "
Additional District Surgeon of Nashik Dr. Nikhil Shendane from the district says, "The number of corona patients has increased so much that the number of doctors is dwindling.
In this situation, everything should not be pushed on the administration.
People should follow the rules, be aware.
Corona has millions of patients, so not everyone can get a bed. "
The death toll has also risen in the village of Shrikant Waghmare, a resident of Harbal in Nanded district.
He says, "The atmosphere in the village is very bad.
At least 2 patients will be found at home.
People do not go to the hospital out of fear.
In our village of 3000 population, 20 deaths have been reported so far in a month due to various diseases."
Adinath Gadhe observes that people have become more aware due to the increase in deaths in villages.
Adinath of Guha village in Ahmednagar district says, "Now there are corona patients in the settlement.
So people are now wearing face masks even if they want to go to mow the grass in the fields.
The death toll in the village has increased, this is the result."
'Rs 4000 for 7 kms'
Grandmother and elder uncle of Sudhir Kakade of Khopeshwar Bolthan village in Gangapur taluka of Aurangabad district have passed away due to corona. 
Now his younger uncle is admitted in the government hospital in Aurangabad.
He told the BBC: "We have 30 to 40 houses in our village.
The village is small.
There is a Gatgram Panchayat.
There is no hospital in the village.
So I tested my uncle's corona at Wadgaon, 4 km from the village.
She tested positive.
They had to be brought to Aurangabad as it was difficult to take them.
"A private ambulance took Rs 4,000 for the 7 km distance from MGM to Ghati (Government Hospital).
Uncle was afraid to be judged in a simple car, so we took him by ambulance.
An ambulance took Rs 17,000 to bring his elder uncle from Ahmednagar to Aurangabad."
The distance from Ahmednagar to Aurangabad is 115 km.
Local journalists also told the BBC that the high cost of ambulances was a major problem in Aurangabad.
Asked about the rates of ambulances, Aurangabad Divisional Commissioner Sunil Kendrakar said, "Most of the smart city buses are deployed as ambulances in Aurangabad.
Apart from this, the hospitals do not charge their own ambulances.
What is the state government doing?
We tried to contact the Minister of Health and the Minister of State for Health to find out exactly what the government is doing about the shortage of beds in rural areas and the rates of private ambulances. 
But no contact has been made yet.
Health Minister Rajesh Tope , meanwhile , had said last year that if the ambulance charged more than the stipulated rate, the license would be revoked and a case would be filed against it.
He also directed to increase the number of beds in government health institutions in view of the increasing number of corona patients in the state.
America finally heard! Corona will supply raw materials for vaccine production
With the second wave of corona in India, the health system has gone through Kollam. 
Therefore, the demand for speedy vaccination is increasing.
 Therefore, the central government has announced to vaccinate everyone above 18 years of age from May 1. 
However, the lack of raw material for vaccine production caused problems. 
Vaccine production was affected by the US intervention. 
Since then, India has repeatedly demanded raw materials from the US. 
After all, the US has agreed to supply raw materials to India for vaccine production. 
This information has been given to India by the Biden administration. 
US Security Adviser Jake Sullivan briefed India's Security Adviser Ajit Doval.
 So once again the emphasis is on vaccine production.
A few days back, Adar Punawala, CEO of Siram Institute, had informed that there was a shortage of raw material for the manufacture of vaccines. 
He said the United States and Europe had cut off supplies.
 Adar Punawala had now joined hands directly with US President Joe Biden as raw materials were still not being supplied. 
After that, the pressure on the US was mounting. 
The US has finally agreed to India's demand and will soon supply raw materials for vaccine production.
 This will eliminate the problem of vaccine production.
The Serum Institute is co-producing the Covishield vaccine with Astrazeneca and Oxford. 
At present, the production of 6 to 6.5 crore doses per month is underway at the Pune serum plant and the target of increasing it to 10 to 11 crore is expected by June this year, said Adar Poonawala.
There was a terrible wave of corona in America last year.
 At that time, India had sent hydrochloricquin from India to America. 
At that time, former US President Donald Trump had made a request to India. 
India had supplied crores of bullets in response to the urgent request.
