Other Poonawalas started preparations for the product in March last year and started stockpiling glass vials and ingredients for the vaccine from August.
The number of vaccines produced during production can be more or less the same or things can go wrong in many stages of production.
It's about science as well as the art of adapting everything, says Agathe Demras.
The manufacturing companies that are now starting production will take several months to produce the actual vaccine.
Will Covax accelerate the delivery of vaccines?
Poonawala says his priority is to supply vaccines to India.
Which vaccine is most commonly used?
The WHO, Gavi Vaccine Scheme and the CEPI - Center for Epidemic Preparedness have all developed the CoVAX scheme.
Countries that cannot afford the vaccine will be provided with a special fund.
The vaccine will cover up to 20 per cent of the population in countries eligible for the vaccine.
Ghana became the first country to receive the vaccine on February 24 under the scheme.
But many of the countries in the Covax scheme are also trying to get vaccinated individually.
Adar Poonawala says that the leaders of almost every country in the African continent have approached him on a personal level for the vaccine.
Agathe Demrais and EIU do not have high hopes for the success of this Covax scheme.
It will make a small difference, but it won't make a big difference, says DeMrass.
The EIU estimates that some countries will not have full vaccinations by 2023, while others will never.
But as long as the virus persists, it will change itself and the infection will continue to spread.
But the good news is that vaccines are being produced faster than ever before.
Demrais says all governments need to provide real information to their people.

Corona Education: This will be a big change in your children's education system
Women
Chess teacher Anuradha Beniwal is teaching students from England and India.
From coronation in London to teaching children in government schools in remote parts of India, his experience has changed dramatically.
The availability of digital tools for digital education has become very important in India.
Beniwal told the BBC in a phone interview that there was a need to change existing education policies.
I take classes on 'Zoom' with a maximum of 10 students in London.
Many schools and universities in Delhi are now offering online education.
In many places, it was easy for us to turn to online.
But, there are some students in the school who have problems with internet connection.
Many private schools in the country have now started taking classes on the Zoom app.
On condition of anonymity, the parents of one or two children told the BBC:
Also, after talking to students, teachers and parents, I realized that the concept of a campus experience has completely changed with Corona.
Our next session is likely to be online.
Once the lockdown is over, there is also the question of how schools and universities should start again.
Some schools have used glass sheets in students.
The online education system may be a new trend, but what difference will it make in the education of students from disadvantaged groups?
Many of the girls were relieved of the hardships of home because of school.
Anuradha teaches in remote areas but even in places like Delhi, the situation is not very satisfactory.
9-year-old Rani Rajput has got admission in a government school in Delhi.
We migrated from Uttar Pradesh to Delhi in search of work.
But, we don't even have a smartphone.
In the post-Corona world, the education sector faces many challenges.
Ritesh Singh is the founder of Eckovation, a social learning platform.
Ritesh has received the Prime Minister's innovation award for creating the app Upgradation for Education.
If you want to make online learning effective, you have to contextualize and personalize it differently for each student, he adds.
For example, a video tutorial made for a student in Delhi would be irrelevant for students in remote areas like Barmer or Latehar.
Riteish and his team are developing a curriculum with regional needs in mind.
But, in the post-Corona era, the question is how the education system based on mobile applications will reach more and more students without smartphones and internet.
This is why Riteish had to think about the TV format.
He says, "A series of syllabus related sections for Class 9th and 12th has started on DD Bihar and Jharkhand from April 20.
But, there are many practical difficulties in keeping the students in front of the TV sets for a long time.
We plan to make the study material available to students through WhatsApp in the future.
Chhaya Ben is a teacher at a government girls' school in Chikodara, Gujarat.
The majority of the 380 girls in our school are from this disadvantaged group.
For students who are on one side of society, corona companionship can be a year-round loss or a long-term opportunity in education, she adds.
Anand Pradhan (24) is one of the youngest educationists in India.
Corona will have to change in order to stay in touch with the education sector in the future.
He says, "Online education is what it is and it will continue to be so.
Anand’s school emphasizes skill development and innovative thinking.
So we try to give each student a skill-based education, so that if there is a problem, it is the students who will find a solution.
But then the question arises as to how the school will ensure that extra-curricular activities will be as important as textbooks.
Bijendra is a group education officer in Rohtak district of Haryana.
We are trying to reach more students through WhatsApp.
We work late into the night to answer questions from such students.
While distributing milk powder in the village, Bijendra and his team surveyed the educational situation of every student in the village.
Even if one does not have digital tools, we are still trying to get the notes to the students through the network of people.
Whether the school is small or large, online education will be a challenge in the post-Corona era, experts say.
Corona virus: India struggles to find new variants
Different strains of the corona virus have been found around the world.
The coronavirus, which spreads the global epidemic of covid-19, also makes small changes in itself as it passes from one person to another.
Often, these small changes, called mutations, are less harmful and do not make much difference to the overall nature of the virus.
However, some mutations cause changes in the spike proteins of the virus.
A new strain or variant of the mutated virus can sometimes be fatal.
Last week, a senior US health official said that the spread of highly contagious variants could lead to a "fourth wave of illness" in the United States.
According to scientists, the variant in Brazil is more contagious and the immune system created by a single infection of the corona may not be effective on this variant.
Researchers around the world studying the genome of the virus are currently exploring such serious changes taking place in the corona virus.
India is the fifth country in the world to discover the genome of corona virus. The first case of coronavirus infection in India was reported in Kerala last January.
Although the number of covid patients across the country seems to be declining, the number of covid patients is increasing in some states.
Although the number of covid patients across the country seems to be declining, the number of covid patients is increasing in some states.
It takes a mechanism to track and store information on the genetics of local samples of the Sars-CoV-2 virus that spreads Covid-19 disease.
The number of corona victims is increasing again in many states of the country.
So far 242 patients of 3 new variants of corona virus have been found in the country.
However, scientists are studying two variants found in patient samples from Maharashtra and Telangana.
In January, a group of genome scientists said that genome sequencing was not happening at full capacity in India.
In most parts of the country, life has returned to normal.
10 genome laboratories have been set up in the country in view of the threat of corona virus variants.
Epidemiologist Dr. Shahid Jameel says, "We need to pay constant attention to the fact that there is no threat from any variant.
And that's why genome sequencing is so important.
In order to check what changes are taking place in the virus, 6000 samples collected from 22 states in India in the last 10 months have been sequenced.
According to researchers at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore has the highest number of mutations in samples compared to any other city in the country.
Researchers have found 3 variants in Bangalore.
In a large and diverse country like India, large-scale genome sequencing is not easy.
Corona sequencing is done by 10 laboratories in India.
For this, first the laboratories have to collect local samples.
Genome sequencing of a single sample can cost up to 75.
Sequencing a sample takes about 48 hours.
A virologist from Cambridge, Dr. Ravindra Kumar Gupta says that in the case of the corona virus, "sequencing is essential to know exactly what is happening.
Dr. Ravindra Kumar Gupta says, "I think sequencing is important.
However, Union Health Minister Dr. As Harshvardhan says, the emphasis is on finding variants of the "endgame of pandamic" as India is nearing the end of its coronavirus infection.
Dr. "The situation in India is good.
He goes on to say, "There is only one thing that can thwart all these efforts, and that is the new deadly variant of the Corona, and it may even be from India."
Corona: 2,000 deaths a day, the highest in Brazil
As many as 2,68,370 patients have died of corona in Brazil so far.
In Brazil, 2,000 corona patients have died in 24 hours.
Brazil has the second highest number of corona deaths in the world after the United States.
The deaths of 2,286 corona patients were recorded on Wednesday (March 10).
Infectious strains of the corona virus are increasing the incidence, experts say.
On March 10, former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva strongly criticized the decisions taken by President J बोrg Bolsonaro during the epidemic.
Bolsonaro was seen wearing a mask for the first time in a month.
Health systems in most of Brazil's major cities are under tremendous pressure and are likely to collapse, warned Fiocruz, Brazil's leading public health center.
Margaret Dalkolo, a doctor and researcher at Fiocruz, said the country had "seen the worst of the epidemic."
2021 is going to be a tough year, too, he told AFP News.
What exactly is the situation?
On Wednesday (March 10), 79,876 new corona patients were registered in the country.
On March 9, 1,972 corona patients died in Brazil.
The highly contagious type of virus has been spreading for some time now.
A total of 2,286 people died on March 10.
According to Fiocruz, 15 state capitals have intensive care units (ICUs) with a capacity of more than 90 percent.
According to reports, the capital Brasilia also now has a full-capacity ICU system.
The report warns that the growing number of corona patients could put a strain on the health system and could lead to its collapse.
Corona first patient: 'My report came a year ago and I was crying for two days'
Our report was positive and we were kept in the isolation ward.
On March 9, 2020, the first Kovid 19 positive patient in Maharashtra was diagnosed.
Savita, the first corona patient in the state, and her husband Suresh (both names have been changed) contracted covid and became the first corona in the state.
That trip to Dubai
The entire family had gone to Dubai to celebrate the 25th wedding anniversary of Suresh and Savita.
After returning from Dubai, Suresh developed a fever and a cold and initially consulted his family doctor.
But after three or four days, he did not feel well and on the advice of his family doctor, he and his wife went to Naidu Hospital on March 9 for a check-up.
When the reports came, the reports of Suresh and Savita were positive.
Some thought we would never come back ...
Suresh started talking about the early days of his treatment, "Our report was positive and our children were also called for examination.
From the second day onwards, the news of the first patient being found in Maharashtra started circulating.
Experience of isolation
Suresh and Savita did not have any physical problems as they did not have any symptoms.
Savita says, "When we got the report, we were worried that nothing would happen to us.
When we started to feel better, we made a video call to our relatives and showed them that we were cool.
After a few days of treatment, both were re-corona tested.
Positive attitude
Suresh says, "When we came home, we were welcomed in the society.
We decided to donate plasma after we were cured.
Looking at it now, a year later, it seems like we need to move on without stopping, despite all these incidents
Why do women who have recovered from corona have more menstrual problems?
Menstruation came much earlier after the corona was released.
Listening to the words of Mumbaikar Rashmi Puranik will make a thorn in the side of any woman.
But, the first shift after Corona is still not forgotten.
I had to hug my abdomen."
Political journalist Rashmi Puranik was infected with Covid-19 in June last year (2020).
Her first period came after overcoming the infection.
Rashmi goes on to say, "Every woman has a pattern of menstruation.
Rashmi had been experiencing shift shifts till December.
After the covid was released, the menstrual cramps increased a lot.
They feel that the change in menstruation is a post impact of Kovid-19.
My period was horrible.
Rashmi is not alone in experiencing menstrual changes after the Covid-19 infection has been cured.
A woman government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said:
But, this time, I felt something had changed in my body more than normal menstrual days, she says.
Padma Priya D, editor of Suno India website, shared her experiences on Twitter after Kovid-19.
Covid can change the menstrual cycle?
About 40 per cent of the total number of coronary patients in Maharashtra are women.
Speaking to the BBC, Fortis Hospital gynecologist Dr. Sonal Kumta says, "Complaints of irregular menstruation, late menstruation, change in bleeding pattern, excessive bleeding have been found in women who have been discharged from the corona."
According to experts, patients with coronary heart disease show other medical problems.
Speaking to the BBC, the former head of the gynecology department at Sir JJ Hospital, Dr. Ashok Anand says, "There are documented reports of swelling of the ovaries in women after covid.
If the ovaries are swollen after a corona infection, there is a chance of discomfort or changes during the menstrual cycle, he said. Happiness continues.
The woman never had a period
Fortis Hospital gynecologist Dr. Sonal Kumta informs a female patient who was freed from the corona infection.
I had a 41-year-old woman who had a corona infection.
What is 'amenorrhea'?
According to Web-MD, 'amenorrhea' means no menstruation.
Menstruation
If a woman has this problem, she will not have menstruation.
Corona and menstruation?
Experts say there is no concrete evidence that corona has a direct effect on the menstrual cycle.
The gynecologist of Hiranandani Hospital, Dr. Manjiri Mehta says, Menstrual changes cannot be directly linked to Covid-19.
Mumbai-based gynecologist Dr. No woman has come to Komal Chavan complaining of menstrual problems after he was released from the corona.
Speaking to the BBC, she said: "Women's menstrual periods change after a long-term illness.
Pet pain
But it needs to be studied, he said. Komal has an opinion.
Changes in the female reproductive system after covid?
Corona infection weakens the body's immune system.
Decreased immunity after covid is likely to weaken the reproductive system.
What should women do?
According to gynecologists, women should take care of themselves
Proper diet, exercise is essential
The body should relax at the right time
Sleep should be on time
Don't sit and work too long. Take a break from work.
After the Covid-19 infection, the body's damage gradually heals.
Did women have menstrual problems in the lockdown?
Dr. Manjiri adds, "Women with PCOD (Polycystic Ovary Disease) did not exercise during the lockdown.
Is Patanjali's Coronil a treatment for Corona?
The combination of herbal medicines is once again claimed to be effective against the corona virus.
There is no evidence that this drug is effective in treating corona.
What is known about coronal context?
Coronil is a blend of medicinal plants traditionally used in Indian medicine.
The drug was first mentioned in June last year.
The marketing of this drug was stopped after the intervention of the Government of India.
The government also said that coronil could be sold as an 'immunity booster'.
Coronil
On February 19, the company held another event.
Union Health Minister Dr. Harshvardhan was criticized by the Indian Medical Association, India's largest association of doctors, for attending the event.
The publicity of 'unscientific medicine' in the presence of the Health Minister is an insult to the people of India and does the Health Minister support this medicine?
Dr. program. We contacted the Ministry of Health to inquire about the presence of Harshvardhan, but we did not receive any response till the article was published.
The Patanjali Company supported the ministers' presence and said, "They did not support Ayurveda (India's traditional medicine) or the modern medical system."
Claims made against the coronal
The company repeatedly claims that its product treats corona. "People have been treated with this drug," Patanjali's managing director Acharya Balkrishna told the BBC.
The company says that scientific tests of the drug have been carried out and the results have been published in several international journals.
For this, the company mentioned a magazine published by MDPI in Switzerland in November 2020.
The experiment was performed on fish.
A global health expert at the University of Southampton in the UK, Dr. Michael Head told the BBC there was a difference between taking pre-clinical trials in a laboratory and getting regulatory approval for something that worked on humans.
He says, "Many drugs respond well in the laboratory but when tested on humans, the drug does not work for a variety of reasons."
Human testing was performed on 95 patients who tested positive for the corona virus between May and June last year.
The findings are being published in the April 2021 issue of Science Direct, Patanjali Company said.
The company said that patients who were given coronal drugs recovered faster than patients who were not given the drug.
It is for these reasons that these conclusions are being called into question.
Has Coronil got official approval?
In December 2020, the Patanjali Company in Uttarakhand asked the state administration to convert Coronil's 'Immunity Booster' license into 'Covid-19' drug.
The company said Coronil was approved in January as a "supportive measure."
The state administration told the BBC that the company had been given a new license but that the drug could not be given as a treatment for corona.
The Director of the Traditional Medical and State Licensing Authority, Dr. Y.S. "Coronil can be sold as a modified license means Zika, Vitamin C, Multi Vitamin or any other supplement," Rawat told the BBC.
“There’s no coronary treatment,” the director explained.
The company also claims to have received the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certificate.
Senior official Rakesh Mittal said in a tweet that Coronel was approved by the WHO but the tweet was later deleted.
India's top drug regulator provides GMP certification under a WHO approved scheme.
Dr. Uttarakhand State Government. Rawat said, "The GMP certificate has nothing to do with the effectiveness of the claim.
The WHO clarified to the BBC that "the effectiveness of any conventional medicine for the treatment of Covid-19 has not been certified."
Dr. at the University of Southampton. "There is still no clear evidence that these products are beneficial for the treatment or prevention of Covid-19," says Head.
The corona vaccine will now be available at a private hospital for Rs 250

9. Is the corona vaccine safe?
Considering that the vaccine on corona should be safe, the Government of India has directed the Drug Controller's Organization to allow the vaccine only when it has passed the results and safety criteria.
The vaccine in India will be safe, the health ministry said.
According to the instructions of the Ministry of Health, one should rest at the health center for half an hour after the vaccination.
If you have any problems after the vaccination, you should immediately contact the nearest health officer, doctor ANM or ASHA activist, the health ministry said in a statement.
10. Who should not get covacin vaccine?
Bharat Biotech company and should not take any vaccine prepared by ICMR, so kampanineca a phektasita is published.
Accordingly, the following persons should not be vaccinated with covacin vaccine.
People with allergies should not be vaccinated.
Do not take this vaccine if you have a fever.
This vaccine should not be taken by those who are taking blood thinners or if they are suffering from bleeding.
People with weakened immune systems should not be vaccinated.

The mask should be continued even after the coronavirus has been vaccinated.
13. Why is the covacin vaccine in dispute?
The Central Drug Controller General has approved Bharat Biotech's 'Covacin' vaccine to be manufactured in India.
Data on the first phase of the covacin trial were published in January 2021 in the medical journal The Lancet.
The Drug Controller General approved the covacin, even though the testing process had not been completed.
Approving the covacin, the Drug Controller General said, "In the public interest, the vaccine has been allowed for restricted use in emergency situations only in clinical trials."
It was mentioned that if the corona virus mutated or changed, it should be allowed to have alternatives.
In the third phase of the clinical trial, 25,800 people will be vaccinated. This process is still ongoing.
The Comptroller General of Drugs has said that covacin is safe.
What is the scientific reason behind approving the vaccine while the test is going on?'
Former president of the International Association of Bioethics, Dr. Anant Bhan says, 'Information on how effective the vaccine is has not been made public.
Explaining his position on the Kovacin controversy, Bharat Biotech President Dr. Krishna Ila said, "According to the Clinical Trial Act in India, if the disease is fatal, emergency approval can be given in the second phase.
Corona virus: quarantine, isolation or segregation, what exactly is segregation?
Think ... what if you had to stay in a closed room for the next 14 days?
Thousands of patients around the world have been quarantined so far in the wake of the corona virus.

Corona: Can a person be infected with corona even after vaccination?
It was November 17, 2009. An 11-year-old boy returned to the United States from the UK.
One week later, the boy attended a religious education program in Sullivan County, New York.

During this time the religious education program continued.
After the children returned home from the program, the virus spread to Brooklyn and Rockhall County, as well as Ocean County and Orange County.
When scientists analyzed all of this, they said that the Chavarusa teaching method had led to the spread of the mumps virus.
Surprisingly in this case, one of the 'super-spreaders' was vaccinated against MMR (measles, mumps and rubella).
In fact, most vaccines relieve symptoms but do not completely protect against infection.
‘Effective’ and ‘sterile’ immunity
Vaccines provide two main types of immunity.
The second is 'sterile immunity', which can completely prevent infection.
Can a person still be infected with corona after vaccination?
Let's take the example of meningitis.
These bacteria hide in the back of the nose or throat.
The Meningitidis vaccine can have two different effects, says Keith Neal, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Nottingham.
How does sterilization immunity work?
An effective immune system usually provides a combination of white blood cells - including B and T cells - with pretty antibodies.
These antibodies stick to the outside and prevent contact with the nose, throat, or lungs. Protects the body as a whole.
In the case of Covid-19, the deficiency of antibodies that identify the virus is linked to the spike protein on its surface, which is used to penetrate the cells.
In order to achieve sterile immunity, vaccines need to promote adequate antibodies to catch any virus particles that enter the body and destroy them immediately.
What type of immunity does the covid-19 vaccine produce?
In short, we know nothing. Because it's still very new, says Neil.
So far, no tests have been performed on the corona vaccine to determine whether the virus can spread.
This means we keep our focus more pragmatically, says Professor Danny Altman.
Scientists already know that antibodies that develop in people after a natural infection with Covid-19 cannot always prevent re-infection.
A study by British healthcare workers found that 17 per cent of those who had antibodies already - probably the first time - were re-infected.
I think there's a lot of questioning about the vaccine for this type of virus.
Fortunately, this is not the end of the story.
There have been recent indications that some vaccines may not completely eradicate the virus, but they can prevent infection.
It is very difficult to prove disinfection immunity.
Since many medical tests have not tested whether the vaccine can stop the spread of the virus, scientists are now looking at how many infections have been detected where large quantities of the vaccine have been distributed.
However, it is difficult to understand exactly, because there are two things.
Let us look at the lymphatic potential.
Oxford-Astrazhenka
The vaccine was tested on Rhesus macaque in July last year.
The author noted that the vaccine does not prevent the spread of the disease.
Let us now turn to the third stage.
According to the results of the test, published in January 2021, those who were given half the dose of the vaccine were 59 percent successful in preventing the virus from infecting them.
Infection figures among those taking half the dose of the vaccine looked promising.
The papers, published in pre-print on February 1, present a few things by studying the people who participated in the tests.
Pfizer-Bioentech
There is still no conclusive evidence that the Pfizer-Bioentech vaccine can prevent people from getting the corona virus.
In early January, Albert Borla, chief executive of the Pfizer vaccine, said tests on the animals showed that the infection did not occur after the vaccine was given.
An Israeli survey found that only two out of 102 medical staff who were given two doses of the vaccine developed "low" levels of antibodies.
Of course, caution is needed in the analysis of these results.
Recently, the Israeli Ministry of Health looked at the health records of 1 million people in the country and found that only 317 out of 7,15,425 people tested positive for corona in a week after the full vaccination.
Again, this was not a medical test, there was no control group, and things like lockdowns could result in lower results, however, the incidence of infection was significantly reduced.
A study by the National Institutes of Health, the McCabe Healthcare Service, found similar results.
Modern
Although the modern test did not pay special attention to whether the vaccine prevents infection, participants were tested for corona infection before taking their first and second doses - meaning it was possible to compare the prevalence of infection in these groups.
It found that two-thirds of asymptomatic people were saved from infection after a single dose.
Novavax
This vaccine has not yet been approved for use anywhere in the world.
According to the company, a study of rhesus macaques prevented the virus from spreading completely when they were given high doses.
These results have included this vaccine in a specific group, which can completely prevent asymptomatic infections.
Now scientists are awaiting the discovery of whether even vaccinated humans can get sterile immunity.
Incomplete herd immunity
Unfortunately, the vaccine's ability to prevent the spread of the virus depends not only on the rules of social discrimination, but also on the effect of herd immunity.
If these vaccines don't completely stop the infection, there will be a need for vaccinations to boost herd immunity, says Michael Head.
Heard immunity is used to provide indirect protection against infectious diseases in people who are immune enough.
Despite the fact that scientists know so much, it is not possible to say with certainty that herd immunity is universally applicable.
For example, according to one statistic, 60-72 percent of the population needs immunity to completely eradicate the infection.
This is even higher than the vaccination targets of many countries.
However, many scientists believe that the corona virus cannot be completely eradicated.
Some scientists say that once enough people have been vaccinated, it is not important whether they are able to spread the virus, but whether everyone will have immunity.
However, for those who cannot be vaccinated, herd immunity is a good option.
Until all this happens, you should remember the story of the 11-year-old boy with mumps that you mentioned at the beginning.
Joe Biden: President's signatures on 10 executive orders to fight Kovid on the battlefield
President Joe Biden has made 10 important decisions to intensify the fight against cowardice 19 in the United States.
Accordingly, the speed of vaccination will be increased and the number of covid tests will also be increased.
Although it will take a few months to overcome this scourge, we will definitely get out of it if everyone comes together, Biden said while announcing these 10 decisions.
Biden's decision comes just days after he was sworn in as the 46th president of the United States.
The new administration has parted ways with former President Donald Trump's policies.
The way the Trump administration handled the issue of Covid's accomplice was widely criticized.
The United States has been hit hardest by the corona virus worldwide, killing more than 4.6 million people so far, according to Johns Hopkins University.
'War situation'
Mr Biden said there was a "big price" to pay for "concrete decisions".
One thing I want to make clear - the situation will worsen and then it will improve, Biden warned.
It's a war situation, he said.
Biden said his plan to vaccinate 100 million people in the first 100 days of his term was "the biggest administrative challenge our country has ever faced."
It will only get worse before the situation improves, President Biden has said.
Anthony Fauchi, chief medical adviser, said the Biden administration was increasing the capacity and scope of existing vaccination schemes.
As expected, if 70 to 85 per cent of the population is vaccinated by the end of summer, life is likely to be somewhat normal by winter, he said.
It will be important to persuade those who are skeptical about the vaccine to get it. Fauchi said.
He said the administration was in talks with some growers to increase vaccine production.
So far, 1.65 million vaccines have been administered in the United States.
What is the new plan?
The administration has announced a seven-phase plan.
The plan calls for the Biden administration to take swift and aggressive action to protect and assist those most at risk of cowardice and those working in essential services.
Biden has made 10 decisions to fight Covid on the battlefield.
The executive order approved by Biden does not need to be approved by the US Congress.
The administration aims to start vaccination centers in stadiums and buildings for local communities and reopen most schools within 100 days.
In addition, before embarking on a journey to the United States, passengers will now have to undergo a covid test to show that their report is negative and will have to be quarantined for 14 days upon arrival in the United States.
Wearing of masks and observing social distance will be mandatory in all government office premises and wearing of masks will also be mandatory in airports, most of the planes, trains and buses.
More financial assistance will be provided to state and local administration officials, and a new office will be set up to oversee implementation across the country.
Production of PPE kits and vaccines will be increased.
The Biden administration has made another decision that deviates from the Trump administration's policies.
What did these 3 Marathi doctors feel after getting the corona vaccine?
Vaccination is starting in India from January 16.
In most countries, vaccinations are preferably given to health care workers, the elderly, or those with cancer.
The vaccination process is somewhat similar everywhere.
The vaccine is given after the side effects have been reported or a consent form has been signed.
How is the experience after vaccination?
Dr. Nikita Bilgi lives in Philadelphia, USA and works as a physical therapist.
We can't stop treating patients because they need physiotherapy after surgery.
On January 9, Nikita received her first dose of the modern vaccine.
But in twenty-four hours the pain subsided.
Nikita has another purpose behind getting vaccinated.
The United States did not have a complete lockdown, but Philadelphia had a semi-lockdown in November-December.
It's important to keep wearing a mask even after getting the vaccine.
Dr. Ashutosh Tondare is a breast cancer surgeon originally from Aurangabad.
"I got the Pfizer vaccine, because it was the only vaccine available when I went to get the vaccine.
The UK is currently experiencing another wave of covid epidemics, so Ashutosh feels the vaccine has arrived at the right time.
The situation is not good, the number of patients is increasing.
Dr. Ameya Kunte is a medical oncologist and oncologist who has been living and working in a hospital in Hamburg, Germany for five years.
The second wave is going on here, the cases were increasing before Christmas.
Even when the first wave of covid came, Dr. Amay was working in the hospital.
There was a time when there was no space left to keep the patients in isolation.
Ameya says the government has provided vaccines to large hospitals in Germany.
Pfizer Bioentech and Modern vaccines are recognized in Europe.
"I started the new year with the vaccine.
It is not clear how long the vaccine will last, or whether it will have some long-term effects, but he says the benefits should be taken into account.
The benefits of vaccination outweigh the disadvantages of not getting vaccinated.

Comparison of vaccines
Oxford University - AstraZeneca vaccine
Tests have shown that the Oxford vaccine provides 70% protection against covid symptoms in humans .
The vaccine has also been shown to boost the immune system of older people.
Statistics from these trials indicate that the vaccine is likely to provide up to 90 percent protection from the corona if the dose of the vaccine is changed.
The UK has ordered 100 million doses of the vaccine.
You will need to take two doses of this vaccine.
Tests are still being conducted with more than 20,000 volunteers.
Of all the vaccines, this one is probably the easiest to deliver because the vaccine does not have to be stored in very cold temperatures.
The vaccine was developed by taking the weakened virus from chimpanzees and modifying it to prevent the spread of the virus in humans.
The results of trials of this vaccine will come before Christmas, said Oxford Vaccine Group's Pvt. Andrew Pollard had said.

Why the need for vaccines?
Many people in the population are still at high risk of being infected with the corona virus.
If the vaccine is available, it will teach the human body's immune system how to fight the corona virus.
Only by combining both vaccines and appropriate treatment methods can this global epidemic of corona virus be stopped.
Corona vaccine tests are underway around the world
Various companies around the world are currently trying to develop vaccines.
Vaccine development stages
10 vaccines are in the third stage.
Russia's Sputnik - 5 vaccines
Researchers claim that the Russian-developed Sputnik-5 vaccine provides 92% protection.
The supply of this vaccine is expected to start in the last month of 2020.

Who is Putin's daughter who was first vaccinated against corona?
India prepares for vaccination drive
The central government on Monday (December 14) announced a regulation on how corona vaccine will be given to everyone in India.
According to PTI, "100 to 200 people will be vaccinated in each session every day.
Also only one person at a time will be allowed to go to the vaccination center.
Where and how to get corona vaccine in India?
Coronavirus vaccine will be available in the first two to three months of 2021, said Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan.
The Oxford vaccine will be produced by the Serum Institute in Pune.
But the government has never said it will vaccinate the entire country.
Corona infection can break the chain of infection if we can vaccinate people who are in a critical condition.
What is the plan of Modi government to make corona vaccine available to the people?
On the other hand, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has announced to set up a task force in Maharashtra for the campaign to be implemented after the vaccine becomes available .
There is a need for clarity on vaccination. A task force has been set up in Maharashtra to discuss the availability of vaccines, number of vaccines, side effects of vaccines, effects of vaccines, cost of vaccines and its distribution, all of which will be discussed, Thackeray said.
What about Indian vaccine tests?
Indian Council of Medical Research - ICMR and Bharat Biotech are jointly developing two vaccines, Kovacin and ZyCovD, which are being developed in India.
Bharat Biotech has also applied to the regulator for permission for immediate use.
The third phase of testing of the covacin has begun.
The second phase of the ZyCoVD vaccine has been completed.
How is the vaccine made?
White blood cells in the human body are involved in the immune system.
Your body is ready to deal with the next virus.
The same virus has been used in vaccines developed over the last several decades.
Similar vaccines are used for diseases like measles, mumps and jaundice. It is also used in flu vaccination.
But a new method is being used to make a vaccine against the corona virus.
How many people need the coronavirus vaccine?
This is a very serious question this year and perhaps this century.
If the corona vaccine became available and became effective, a few hundred billion people worldwide would have to be vaccinated.
Who will be vaccinated first?
Therefore, in the early stages, it is necessary to plan who should be vaccinated.
This is because people in this age group have a higher mortality rate due to Covid-19.
What to do until vaccinated?
It is a fact that vaccination saves a person from getting sick.
Maintaining a safe distance means social distance, wearing a mask and washing your hands frequently.
Corona covacin: What is the controversial covacin vaccine?
The Central Drug Controller General has approved the indigenous vaccine 'Covacin' against the Covid-19 virus.
However, the vaccine has been found to be in dispute after emergency use was approved.
The vaccine test has not been completed.
What is covacin?
Covacin is a vaccine against the corona virus.
According to the Central Drug Controller General, covacin is made from inactivated corona virus.
According to experts, the virus cannot be infected because it is inactive.
Who developed the covacin vaccine?
The vaccine is manufactured by Bharat Biotech Company, Hyderabad.
The vaccine is being developed jointly by Bharat Biotech and the Indian Council of Medical Research
At what stage is covacin produced?
There are three stages in vaccine production.
The first two phases of the covacin test have been completed.
According to the Central Inspector General of Drugs, the third phase of the covacin vaccine is currently being tested.
Bharat Biotech President Dr. Speaking to reporters, Krishna Ila said, "24000 volunteers have been registered in the third phase trial of Kovacin.
Is covacin safe?
Covacin has the ability to detect altered strains of the corona virus, according to the Subject Expert Committee.
In the first and second phase, 800 people were vaccinated, while in the third phase, 22,500 people have been vaccinated so far.
Central Director General of Drugs Dr. V. J. According to Somani, ‘Covacin has been manufactured on the Viro Cell platform.
Covacin was found to be safe during the test.
The company claims that the vaccine is safe and effective in animal tests.
How does the covacin vaccine work?
After the vaccine is injected, the body's immune system will recognize the virus.
Tests for covacin showed increased levels of antibodies in the body, according to central officials.
Controversy over Covaxi's approval
A third phase clinical trial of covacin is underway.
Is the vaccine effective?
So, it is alleged by the political parties that the government has resorted to classical protocol to make its own chest grow.
Why was Covacin allowed for emergency use?
This was discussed by the Subject Expert Committee before the covacin was approved.
• December 30, 2020- Expert Committee recommends that India Biotech be informed of immunogenicity, safety and vaccine effectiveness.
• January 1, 2021 - The committee noted that the new strain of Las Corona is effective.
• January 2, 2021 - The company presented research on animals.
In view of the above, the Committee recommended that ‘in view of the wider public interest and precautionary measures, the vaccine should be allowed for restricted use in emergency situations in clinical trials’.
It was mentioned that if the corona virus mutated or changed, it should be allowed to have alternatives.
A cold storage in Mumbai
Steps in approving the vaccine
There are three stages in vaccine production.
Dr. Nagpur in Maharashtra. The first and second stages of covacin were tested at Gillurkar Multispeciality Hospital.
Stage 1 - Does anyone suffer after vaccination?
Stage II - This is followed by another dose of vaccine on the 14th day.
What is the safety and efficacy of the vaccine?
The vaccine is considered safe if it does not cause serious side effects on the body.
The efficiency of the vaccine is very important.
The chief scientist of the World Health Organization, Dr. Saumya Swaminathan said in a press conference, "Generally, if the vaccine is 70 per cent or more effective, we can call it a vaccine.
If the vaccine is less than 30 per cent effective, it will not have a good effect.
Is there any risk due to approval in the third phase of the clinical trial?
No information has been released about the third phase of the test.
What is the benefit to the common man?
Experts believe that in the current situation, there is no point in allowing covacin to the general public.
The President of AIDS Society of India, Dr. Ishwari Prasad Gilada says, "Whether the covacin is effective has not been made public yet.
Doctors will consider giving the vaccine as they do not know about the vaccine and people will oppose taking the vaccine.
Experts say the government will consider covacaine if at some point there is a sudden shortage of vaccines or cases increase.
Corona Vaccine: Why exactly was there a dispute between Serum and Bharat Biotech?
The beginning of the new year was a relief for all Indians.
On January 2, there was a dry run of Corona Lashi across the country.
On Sunday (January 3), the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) approved two anti-corona vaccines in India.
But a statement by Adar Poonawala, owner of Serum Institute of India (SII), sparked controversy.
What exactly is an argument?
In an interview, Adar Poonawala said, "Only three vaccines, Pfizer, Moderna and Covishield, have passed all the scientific tests.
After Adar Poonawala's statement, the effectiveness of Bharat Biotech's 'Covacin' vaccine began to be questioned.
Dr. Krishna Ila said, "We are 200 per cent humble about our medical tests and yet we face criticism.
Of course, Dr. Although Krishna Ila did not name anyone, his target was Adar Poonawala.
Opinions were also expressed in the political arena.
Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot tweeted that the dispute between Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech was unfortunate.
Gehlot also expressed the need for the Prime Minister to intervene in the dispute.
After realizing that the controversy was escalating, Serum Institute owner Adar Poonawala tweeted an explanation.
Shortly afterwards, Serum Institute owner Adar Poonawala and Bharat Biotech's managing director Dr. Krishna Ila issued a joint statement.
What is in the joint letter of 'Serum' and 'Bharat Biotech'?
Other Poonawala and Dr. Krishna Ila spoke on behalf of both Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech and discussed the production of corona vaccine and the supply of vaccine worldwide, including in India, the statement said.
The main challenge before us is to save the lives of people all over the world, including India, they said.
Both vaccines (Covishield and Covacin) have been approved by the EUA for emergency use.
Overall, Poonawala and Dr. Krishna Ila tried to cover up the controversy in the joint letter and said that there was harmony between the two vaccine companies.
When an attempt is made to suppress anti-government voices under the name of Corona ...
Safura Jargar was arrested in April.
Safura Jargar was three months pregnant when she was arrested in the Indian capital, Delhi.
By the time she was arrested on April 10, the number of corona virus cases in India was growing rapidly.
The government had made it clear in its guidelines that corona health crises could be more dangerous for pregnant women.
After Safura's release from jail, he spoke to BBC correspondent Geeta Pandey.
Critics of the Citizenship Amendment Act describe the law as "aimed at the Muslim community."
An epidemic caused by the corona virus
But no one took to the streets to demand his release.
The lockdown was imposed in India on March 25 due to the corona virus.
But while all these reactions are taking place, the popularity of many governments has increased as people sought the help of the government for guidelines in times of crisis.
Joseph Benedict of Sivakas, a global coalition of civil society organizations and activists, told the BBC:
It also means that man and civil rights have taken a step back.
Civic's report
According to a recent report by Civicus, "Several governments in the Asia-Pacific region have banned publishers of reports of government harassment.
Apart from this, monitoring and trekking has also increased.
At least 26 countries in the region have enacted strict laws, according to the Civicus report.
A shocking message
Apart from Safoor, all other human rights defenders and activists in India (including 82-year-old Father Stein Swami Parkinson's disease) have been arrested on charges of treason, criminal defamation and anti-terrorism.
This situation has inspired many organizations to raise their voices.
Maitreyi Gupta, India's legal adviser to the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), told the BBC that he had repeatedly tried to free political prisoners.
However, despite international pressure, the arrests continue unabated.
The government has always tried to show that those arrested are acting against the interests of the country.
During an epidemic
The arrest of Tericita Knoll, a 62-year-old activist in the Philippines, has caused a stir.
Knoll is suffering from heart disease and asthma and was arrested on charges of kidnapping and illegal hostage-taking.
Most of these people were either activists or journalists.
Meanwhile, Abz-CBN, the country's largest media network, was forcibly shut down in May.
As a result, many important information did not reach the people during the epidemic.
Attack on freedom
Bangladesh also shut down several websites.
Bidya Shrestha, a Newar activist in Nepal, told the BBC that the government had used the epidemic to harm the Newar community.
The Civicus report also mentions Cambodia, Thailand, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.
Myanmar has also been criticized for using extremism as an excuse to suppress freedom of expression.
However, sometimes government action is not directly linked to the epidemic.
Attack on freedom
The National Security Act was passed in Hong Kong in June.
The use of surveillance technology in countries such as South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong has played a very effective role in controlling the virus.
Many of the laws passed this year and the arrests are likely to have a lasting effect even after the epidemic.
Corona: Uddhav Thackeray will inform the Center about the segregation of those who have traveled abroad
Eight passengers from Maharashtra who returned from the UK were found to have symptoms of the new corona, including five from Mumbai, one each from Pune, Thane and Mira Bhayandar.
All of them are in segregation and their contact tracing is underway.
Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray today (January 4) held a meeting at Varsha on corona vaccination and discussed with the health department and the municipal commissioner about the new virus that has infected eight passengers from Britain and instructed them to be more vigilant.
The dry run of the corona vaccination took place recently.
The Chief Minister said that passengers arriving in Mumbai directly from the UK are sent to the airport for institutional segregation as per the rules.
Eight passengers infected with the new corona virus are currently undergoing institutional isolation and are being monitored.
A new strain of corona virus was found in the UK
News of the discovery of a new strain of the corona virus in the UK has been circulating for the past few days.
The new species is spreading faster than the original species of corona virus. But this species is not very lethal.
Corona virus vaccines are currently being marketed.
But it is not yet clear how the vaccine affects the new species of corona.
Why are corona covshield and covacin vaccines being objected to?
The Drug Controller General of India - DCGI on Sunday approved two vaccines on Covid-19 for emergency use.
Two vaccines, Covishield and Covacin, have been approved.
After the UK approved the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in emergencies, it was speculated that Kovishield would also be allowed in India.
Some other health workers, including the Congress party, have objected to the early approval of Kovacin.
What are the objections?
How was this permission granted without disclosing the test results of the third phase of both Covishield and Covacin vaccines?
During the third phase of testing for a vaccine, the vaccine is tested on a large number of groups, and the test results determine the percentage of people who are found to be effective.
The results of the third phase tests of Pfizer Bioentech, Oxford-Astrazenka and Mordana vaccines, which are recognized in different countries around the world, are different.
In India, along with covacin, there are also objections to how effective Covishield is.
Covishield was tested in the third phase on 1,600 volunteers in India, and its figures have not yet been released.
The first and second phases of the vaccine were tested on 800 volunteers, and the third phase of the trial is expected to test the vaccine on 22,500 people, but no figures have been released.
Who took the objection?
Congress leader Shashi Tharoor tweeted after Kovacin was allowed to be used for emergencies.
Tagging the Union Health Minister, he said, "The third phase of testing for the covacin has not yet taken place.
After Shashi Tharoor's tweet, the political discussion started.
Doctors are in a dilemma about these vaccines. Called Swapnil Parikh.
I think it's time to get rid of the regulator's hurdles and get the process done as soon as possible.
After the opposition and many health workers raised questions, Union Health Minister Dr. Harshvardhan tweeted that Kovacin is effective.
In the first tweet, he says, "It is a shame for anyone to politicize on such a serious issue.
The Union Health Minister later tweeted several times in support of Kovacin, but did not mention the figures for the third phase of testing.
Vaccines based on encoded spike proteins, which are recognized worldwide, are up to 90 percent effective and covacin contains other antigenic episodes along with inactivated virus-based spike proteins, making the vaccine as safe and effective as any other vaccine.
The covacin vaccine is also effective on newer variants of the corona virus. Harshvardhan said.
He also tweeted that Kovacin had been approved for emergency use on certain conditions.
He says, "Those who spread rumors that emergency use of covacin in clinical trial mode is subject to certain conditions should be noted.
What do the test takers say?
Dr. Nagpur. The first two phases of covacin were being tested at Gillurkar Multispeciality Hospital.
The covacin vaccine has not been shown to have any major adverse effects on the body.
"Sometimes it feels like a fever after being vaccinated.
What does Bharat Biotech have to say?
Krishna Illa, president of Bharat Biotech, which manufactures covacin, has issued a statement in this regard.
But neither Bharat Biotech nor DCGI have provided any statistics on how effective and safe the vaccine is.
The head of AIIMS Hospital in Delhi, Dr. Speaking to ANI, Randeep Guleria said, "Suppose there is a sudden increase in cases in case of emergency and if the vaccine is needed, the Bharat Biotech vaccine will be used.
Commenting on Guleria's statement, senior journalist Tavalin Singh said, "What exactly does this mean?
It has been called the 'indigenous vaccine' since its inception.
After the two vaccines were allowed, Prime Minister Narendra Modi wrote in a tweet, "The two vaccines that have been allowed for emergency use are both made in India.
Shekhar Gupta, a senior journalist, writes about Lashi's nationalism:
Saying that this vaccine is 'Made in India', Prime Minister Modi expressed his pride, while BJP chief J. P. Nadda tweeted criticizing the opposition.
He tweeted that the Congress is not proud of any Indian thing.
He writes, "Congress and the Opposition are not proud of any Indian thing.
Both of these vaccines are 110 percent safe. G. Somani said.
After both vaccines are approved for emergency use, the vaccine will now be given to health workers and frontline workers first.
India aims to vaccinate 300 million people by July 2021.
Corona vaccine: Where and how to get it in India?
A committee of experts has approved the emergency use of two vaccines (Covacin and Covishield).
The recommendation to allow both the vaccines has been accepted, said V.S. G. Somani gave.
Cadillac vaccine will be tested in the third phase.
DCGI has held a press conference on the corona vaccine.
The DGCI Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) takes the final decision regarding the use of the vaccine.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has tweeted that with the approval of the vaccines, India will now move towards coronation-free.
After the DCGI press conference, Adar Punawala, head of the Serum Institute of India, tweeted that the covshield vaccine was safe, effective.
Indian Drug Controller V. G. Somani also spoke about the potential of covishield and covacin.
If there had been any breach of safety, the Indian drug regulator would not have given the go-ahead.
The coronavirus vaccines were allowed, which means the Indian government can now enter into agreements with both companies.
The Indian government is trying to vaccinate 300 million people this year.
India Biotech's Kovaxi Nala allowed
Yesterday (January 2, 2021), a committee of DCGI experts recommended that India Biotech's vaccine on corona be allowed for emergency use, government sources told ANI.
Covaxin is a vaccine on the corona of Bharat Biotech, an Indian-made vaccine.
Work is underway around the world on vaccines against the corona virus.
The central government on Monday (December 14) announced a regulation on how corona vaccine will be given to everyone in India.
According to PTI, "100 to 200 people will be vaccinated in each session every day.
Also only one person at a time will be allowed to go to the vaccination center.
These instructions to the states state the use of technology.
The digital platform will be used to track vaccine recipients as well as the corona virus vaccine.
Only those who are registered at the vaccination centers will be vaccinated.
The Center has instructed the states to plan according to which company's vaccines will be available in which states.
According to the Covid Vaccine Operational Guidelines, the vaccinated box, bottle or ice-pack should not be exposed to direct sunlight.
The vaccine will be taken out of the storage area only after the person arrives to inject it.
Challenges in vaccination
The Centre's regulations also mention the potential challenges that may arise during the vaccination campaign.
Covid vaccine labels may not have Vaccine Wheel Monitors (VVM) and expiry date.
Make a comprehensive distribution system for the vaccine.
According to the central government, vaccination is a major challenge in a country of 130 crore people.
Also, public concern and questions about who will be vaccinated first will be a challenge.
Rumors, negative news and misinformation about the effects of vaccines can be spread on social media.
How will the vaccination be done?
The vaccination team will consist of five people, PTI said.
According to the rules, "100 people will be vaccinated in each session.
The covid vaccine will be given for the first time to health workers, frontline workers and people over the age of 50.
Only after the completion of all these vaccinations will the general public be vaccinated according to their availability.
Based on the availability of vaccines, people over the age of 50 can be classified.
According to the rules, the central government plans to vaccinate 30 crore people in the first phase of the vaccination drive.
Citizens need to register on the Co-Win website to get vaccinated.
2020: About Corona and Living with Corona - Blog
It should not be a surprise to find such records as the Covid Sun or the Corona Sun in the near future, as is the case with AD or Hijri.
Leave out the fun part of it but there is no denying that our lives have changed internally and externally in this one year.
The traveling guest landed
From November 2019 to February 2020, we talked a lot about the corona virus in BBC World. But at the time, the news might have seemed as interesting as 'Some Hubei province in China, some Wuhan city where a virus called corona is spreading'.
But from February, the picture began to change.
All this time as a journalist it was unimaginable challenges.
The baby was six months old at the time, so items such as tripods and microphones were not a threat, but the situation was likely to change soon.
Journalists often talk about 'beats'.
Put aside the superpowers etc. for a moment but still regret the fact that you have to constantly beg for common things like wash your hands, don't spit in the open.
The joke is that our 15-year-old boy imitates anyone who comes into the house to wash his hands and points to the bathroom.
Exiting after 17 days of quarantine
Things like shift time constraints, personal and professional boundaries and timelines became loose throughout the year.
The incessant efforts of scientists, doctors, and pharmacists to control the disease were astounding.
The latest research from around the world should be told to them and then posts like 'Corona dies after eating garlic' or 'Corona is a rumor to fill the pockets of pharma companies' should be seen on their social media accounts.
The grief of those who lost their jobs, their homes, their loved ones was great, but this black cloud also had a silver lining.
'Don't be positive, Dad!'
For several weeks in a BBC Marathi podcast, I used to tell the three-pronged audience to wash their hands at least once, use a mask and keep a distance.
I don't remember ever wanting a positive result in my life, but in the case of Corona, it happened.
17 days! The day was getting darker and darker in all the three triple doses of medicine, finger oximeter, temperature measurement.
The flaws in the health system that were known from the experiences of others could now be experienced.
After 14 days, 'Arogya Setu' voluntarily turned red and green and we were healed automatically by the government court.
During Covid's time, the journey was almost short.
Every day, every year we are being taught something without knowing it.
Narendra Modi: 'People will get vaccine produced in India'
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that efforts are in the final stages to ensure that the vaccine produced in India reaches all sections of the country expeditiously.
No vaccine has yet been approved by Indian regulators.
The vaccines currently being produced in India include Serum Institute's Covishield, Zydus Cadillac's Zykov D, Bharat Biotech's Covaxin and Dr.
Earlier, the head of the Vaccine Task Force and a member of the Policy Commission, Dr. V. K. Speaking about the cold storage system in India, Paul had said that cold storage at a temperature of 2 to 8 degrees has been set up to store the vaccine.
Ultra cold storage is required for storage of Modern or Pfizer vaccines.
What did Modi say?
Modi unveils cornerstone of AIIMS at Rajkot, Gujarat.
PTI has reported in this regard.
Preparations for corona vaccination in India are in the final stages.
Issues raised by Modi -
The number of corona victims in the country is declining.
Modi has also said that the Ayushman Bharat Yojana has saved Rs 30,000 crore for the poor.
Earlier I used to say that if there is no medicine then there is no laxity, even medicine and strictness.
Today is the last day of the year to thank the millions of doctors, cleaners, and drugstore staff who work in Corona.
Corona: Another 14 new corona patients were found in India, bringing the total to 20
Patients with a new strain of the corona virus found in Britain are now found in India as well.
Out of these 20 patients, 8 patients are in Delhi alone, while seven patients have been registered in the lab in Bangalore.
According to the central government, those returning to India from the UK are being traced between November 25 and December 23.
On the other hand, such flights from UK to India and from India to UK will be closed till January 7.
Experts say the new strain is spreading faster than the previous corona virus.
More than one crore people have been infected with corona in India so far.
A new strain of the corona virus, Strain, can wreak havoc and get your health system out of control, said Critical Care Expert Dr. A. Fatahuddin had expressed this while speaking to the BBC.
Work is underway to find citizens who have come in contact with six Indians infected with the new corona virus.
RT-PCR tests are being conducted on all passengers arriving in India from the UK at all international airports in the country.
Samples of patients coming corona positive are sent to a government-approved laboratory for genome sequencing.
Over the past month, 33,000 passengers have arrived in India from the UK.
A new strain of the corona virus has once again led to restrictions on tourism around the world.
The number of patients with the new type of corona is growing rapidly in the UK.
What is the new type of corona?
The new variant, first discovered in southern England in September, has been blamed for the rapid spread of the new virus in recent weeks due to an increase in positive cases in London, south-east England and the east of England.
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that two-thirds of those found to be corona positive may have a new strain of corona.
In the new type of corona, three factors appear to come together.
The new strain is rapidly replacing other versions of the virus.
The new type of mutation affects some parts of the virus.
Some of these mutations have already been shown in the laboratory to increase the ability of cells to increase infection in viruses.
For these reasons, the new strain could spread more rapidly, says James Gallagher, the BBC's health and science correspondent.
Corona vaccine: The use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is recognized in the UK
The Oxford vaccine has been developed in record time.
The use of a vaccine developed by Oxford University to prevent coronavirus infection has been approved in the UK.
This recognition could be crucial in terms of accelerating the vaccination campaign in the UK.
The UK has ordered 100 million vaccines from AstraZeneca, a company that produces vaccines.
Approved by drug regulators, this vaccine has proven to be safe and effective.
Oxford-AstraZeneca began developing the vaccine in early 2020.
The Pfizer-BayTech vaccine was approved in the UK in December.
The first dose of the vaccine was given to Margaret Keenan after clinical trials.
Now that the Oxford-AstraZenka vaccine has been approved, there will be a huge increase in vaccinations, as the vaccine is cheaper and easier to produce in large quantities.
Most importantly, the vaccine can be stored in a general freezer.
Preference will be given to senior citizens, residents of care homes, health workers for vaccination.
The vaccine was approved after Public Health England said the rate of infection was rising rapidly, as well as health workers in Wales, Scotland and the South of England expressing concern about increasing pressure on the National Health Service (NHS).
How does this vaccine work?
In traditional vaccines - ie vaccines given to infants from time to time after birth as well as in childhood - the virus is implanted in the body by weakening a part of the original virus or by weakening the original virus.
Instead, Oxford researchers created the ChAdOx1-chimpanzee adenovirus Oxford.
Scientists have discovered a virus that infects chimpanzees.
Before Covid, 330 people were vaccinated against ChAdOx1.
The vaccine, which is made from the chimpanzee virus, has undergone genetically modified changes, so humans are less likely to become infected after being vaccinated.
It contains a blueprint for the corona virus.
When this blueprint enters the body, it begins to produce the corona virus spike protein.
Is 2020 the year with the highest number of deaths in human history?
The coming year 2020 will go down in history as the 'Year of the Corona'.
The conflict in the Middle Ages, the Great War of the last century, took place in selected parts of the world.
Death figures were coming in daily from each province.
There are two parts to this question.
Heart disease is the leading cause of death
The spread of the corona virus spread rapidly, and the death toll from around the world was alarming.
But is that the highest number of human deaths due to corona this year?
In one of his articles, the World Economic Forum has given statistics on human deaths due to other causes in the wake of the horrific deaths caused by corona worldwide this year.
According to those figures, when a total of 5.6 crore people died worldwide in that year, 1 lakh 47 thousand 118 people died every day.
According to the statistics, 10724 people died every day due to respiratory disorders, 7010 people died due to lung infections and 2615 people died due to HIV / AIDS.
The World Health Organization (WHO), in an article published on December 9, 2020, has given the statistics of deaths in 2019.
Heart disease and respiratory disorders are the first two major causes of death in millions.
Non-communicable diseases accounted for 74 percent of all deaths in 2019.
If we compare these figures with the worldwide deaths due to corona infection so far this year, we get a clear idea.
This figure is even lower than the number of deaths from heart disease worldwide each year.
But if it caused the most human deaths, the answer is a resounding no.
Previous global crises and human deaths
The second part of our original question may have come to the minds of many when they heard these death figures from all over the world during the Coronation period.
Human history has to deal with adversity even in the face of adversity, to fight toxins when medical knowledge and technology were not available, to quench hunger when economics did not carry out a comprehensive plan to satisfy everyone's hunger, the many wars imposed by the dream of expansionism.
Therefore, even before this, we have seen many such incidents in history when death has been like a torment.
The most unfortunate of these was 1918, when the Spanish flu swept the world.
The world was recovering from the devastation of World War I, and the Spanish flu was spreading.
In India, too, the plague had taken its toll, killing about 18 million people. It was about 6 per cent of India's population at that time.
That was a century ago, so medical knowledge was also less than it is today.
Many lives are lost in a short period of time in wars.
World War II is considered to be the worst ever.
Many deaths were reported, many not understood.
One more year can be said to be the history of India which witnessed the ordeal of death in 1943 when there was a famine in Bengal.
The death toll in the then British Empire is said to be six times higher than in World War II.
Then World War II broke out and the soldiers were criticized for not reaching the hungry in Bengal due to food shortages.
There are many periods in history in which human life ended before their natural period.
The only record here is that even more devastating periods have come and gone and there are still more life-threatening medical crises than corona, but man is still standing.
Corona: Journalist jailed for reporting infection in Wuhan
A Chinese journalist covering a corona infection in Wuhan has been sentenced to four years in prison.
The arrested journalist was identified as Zhang Zhan.
Zhang Zhan, 37, was arrested in May. She had been fasting for the past few months.
Zhang was one of several civilian journalists who were affected by the Wuhan crisis.
There are no independent media in China.
Zhang Zhan looked very exhausted after the sentencing, Ren Quanyu, one of Zhan's lawyers, told AFP.
While reading the verdict, Zhang's mother burst into tears in court, Ren said.
'Rebellious Personality'
In a video interview with a filmmaker before his arrest, Zhang said he decided to go to Wuhan in February after reading a post written by a citizen about the city's environment during the Corona outbreak.
Once there, Zhang began to write about the pictures he saw on the streets of Wuhan, as well as in the hospital.
According to the Network of Chinese Human Rights Defenders, Zhang's report stated that he had written about the arrests of other journalists as well as the harassment of families expecting accountability from the government.
Maybe I was rebellious from the beginning and just trying to bring out the truth.
I'm not going to stop what I'm doing.
According to the CHRD, Zhang had been missing since May 14.
He was charged in November.
Zhang was also accused of giving interviews to foreign media and spreading false information about the infection in Wuhan.
Zhang went on a hunger strike to protest his arrest, and his condition worsened.
When I met Zhang in early December, he was being force-fed through a tube, Zhang's lawyers said in a statement.
They also needed help to get to the bathroom.
Zhang was also arrested in 2019.
Leo Lan, an adviser at CHRD, said it was a "warning" to respond to Zhang's sentencing.
The sentence handed down to them is harsh.
I am also concerned about other civilians who have been detained for reporting on corona infections.
Journalists Li Zhehua, Shen Qishi and Fang Bin, who covered the situation in Wuhan, were also missing.
Lee came forward a few days ago. He accused her of forcibly quarantining him.
Corona virus test: Will a new corona test be a 'game changer'?
The extent of corona testing has been a topic of discussion in the country since its inception.
A team of scientists has developed an important and inexpensive test to speed up testing.
This new corona test is based on a genetic editing technology known as Crisper.
Feluda can detect corona infection within an hour, and the cost is estimated at around Rs 500 crore, scientists say.
Feluda is being manufactured by Tata Company.
This is a very simple, easy, reliable and reasonably priced test, Professor K Vijay Raghavan, the Government of India's chief scientific adviser, told the BBC.
Work on the 'Feluda' test is underway at the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) in Delhi.
The sensitivity of this new test was found to be 96 percent and the specificity 98 percent.
This means that the first scale (sensitivity) does not lead to 'false negative', while the second scale (specificity) does not lead to 'false positive'.
The number of corona patients in the country has crossed six million.
Initially the speed of testing was low but now more than one lakh tests are being done daily from more than 1200 labs across the country.
The first of these tests is the polymerase chain action or PCR swab test.
The incidence of positive and false negative conclusions is relatively low.
Antigen tests are cheaper than PCR.
Although the number of tests in India has increased, it is still not enough, says Dr. Krishna Kumar, a researcher on global health and health policies.
People still have to wait a long time and the availability of test kits is not enough, he said.
The 'Feluda' test can be an alternative to the antigen test, said Dr. Bhan thinks.
The new test is as reliable as PCR and takes less time.
Sample collection for 'Feluda' test will be done in the same way as PCR test.
In PCR test, the sample is sent to an accredited laboratory.
Crispr is used in the new Feluda test.
According to researchers, genetic editing is done in the same way as in a Word file.
When Crisper technology is used in tests to diagnose infections such as Feluda, the technology identifies the genes that carry the Novel Corona virus and concludes on paper.
If two blue lines appear on the paper, the test is positive, if one blue line appears, the test is negative.
We have to do our best to increase the limited number of tests.
Considering the stages of testing, the test based on Crisper will be the 'third wave'.
We need to do our best to increase the number of tests.
Many companies and research institutes in the US and UK are producing such paper strips. 
"We are trying to develop a test that does not rely on machines and maximum manpower.
"India has an opportunity to show how important this test can be, because India has a large population and this test has been developed only when there is a need to increase the number of tests," he said.
"If this test is effective, it could be beneficial for many countries in the world," he said.
The vaccine is important to prevent coronavirus outbreaks, but accurate and reliable tests are also needed to streamline everything. 
Corona virus strain: New strain of corona virus is spreading in South Africa
The discovery of a new strain of corona virus in Britain has raised concerns around the world.
Two new cases of the corona virus, found in South Africa, have also been found in Britain.
At the press conference, Matt Hancock said, "The two infected people who were infected with the new strain of corona virus in Britain came in contact with some people from South Africa a few days ago."
He added: "The potential for new strains of the virus to be transmitted is high and therefore the discovery of a new strain of the virus is worrisome.
Britain has since temporarily suspended air traffic from South Africa.
The discovery of a new strain of the corona virus in Britain has raised concerns around the world.
Dr. of Public Health England. Susan Hopkins says, "The new strain of the corona virus found in South Africa is very different from the strain we found in Britain.
Both types of the corona virus appear to be spreading rapidly.
The spread of the new strain in South Africa will also be brought under control and the imminent vaccine will be effective on both strains, he said.
There is no evidence at the moment that the vaccine will be effective on new strains.
Explaining this, she said, "When a new virus enters the body, the vaccine works to build the immune system to fight against it.
Corona virus: Corona's new strain reaches many European countries, the threat increased
Several European countries have reported new and more contagious strains of the corona virus.
Now Spain, Sweden and Switzerland have also said that a new strain has been found in their country through travelers from Britain.
Many countries have suspended air travel to Britain following reports of a new strain of the corona virus.
Three relatives of a man returning from Britain were found infected with the corona virus in the Spanish capital, Madrid, on Thursday (December 24th).
One-fourth of the infected patients are from returnees from the UK.
In addition, three new suspected patients have been identified.
Patients were also found in France, Switzerland, Spain and Sweden
France first reported on Saturday (December 26) that a man returning from Britain had contracted a new species of corona.
France cut off traffic between Britain and Britain after learning of a new strain of the virus.
The country's borders were opened to European citizens on Wednesday, December 23.
In addition to Spain and France, three new species of infected patients were found in Switzerland.
Switzerland was the only country to keep its borders open for foreign tourists on the eve of Christmas.
A Swedish tourism company also reported a patient.
In addition, people in Denmark, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Australia have been diagnosed with new strains of the corona virus.
In Japan, too, five Japanese nationals returning from Britain were found to be corona positive.
The new strain of corona virus was first identified in London, southeastern Britain and eastern Britain.
According to the UK's Office for Statistics, "Currently two-thirds of the country's corona-positive patients may be infected with the new species.
These three things about the corona have created an atmosphere of concern in the world.
A new strain of the corona virus is spreading rapidly.
The changes in the area affecting human cells in the virus.
Laboratories have shown that these mutations increase the virus's ability to infect human cells.
According to the BBC's health and science correspondent James Gallagher, all of these factors could cause Corona's new strain to spread more rapidly.
However, in the current context, experts believe that vaccines being developed around the world may also have an effect on this species.
Restrictions on travel to Britain from many countries
Meanwhile, more than 40 countries have imposed restrictions on flights from Britain.
So, on Saturday (December 26), Japan made a similar decision.

New strain of corona virus 'super spreader' spreads 70 per cent faster - Policy Commission
Concerns have been raised again that the virus has changed as the number of coronaviruses in India has been declining.
The rate of transmission of this new type of corona virus is enormous.
However, not a single person infected with the new strain of the corona virus has been found in India so far. K. Paul has said.
Each virus changes itself.
According to the Union Ministry of Health, the number of active coronaviruses in India has come down to less than 3 lakh.
Speaking at the press conference, Dr. V. K. Paul said: "We are in a good position and we need to keep up the pace.
He added: "After talking to researchers in the UK, we found that changes in the virus have greatly increased their ability to infect.
Although there have been some changes in the corona virus, it has not increased the severity of the disease.
A total of 17 mutations have been reported in the new strain of the virus found in the UK.
Talking about the steps taken by the central government after the new strain of corona virus came to light, Dr. V. K. "The government is paying close attention to this.
Airlines in the UK are completely closed until 31 December.
Travelers arriving in India from the UK are being tracked and their condition is being monitored.
Will the corona vaccine be affected?
Will the altered form of the corona virus have any effect on the corona vaccine?
Speaking about this, Dr. "The new strain of Covid-19, currently found in the UK, does not appear to make any difference to vaccine effectiveness," Paul said.
From the discussions we have had with researchers in the UK, our colleagues at the World Health Organization and our study, we can say that there is no need to panic.
However, given the increased potential to infect new strains of the corona virus, people need to be more vigilant and strictly follow the rules of frequent hand washing, observing social distance, wearing masks, keeping doors and windows open and avoiding crowded places, he said. .
No need to panic about the new strain of corona virus - WHO
Restrictions have been placed on air travel in the UK.
The new strain of the corona virus has caused concern in Europe.
The suspension on the flight will quarantine passengers arriving from the UK
The European Union, as well as many countries, are considering suspending transport links to the UK as the altered corona virus poses a growing risk of infection in the UK.
Germany, France and Italy have suspended flights to and from the UK.
Canada has also decided to suspend flights to the UK.
India has also canceled all flights to and from the UK by 31 December 2020.
The altered form of the corona virus is more susceptible to infection.
There is no concrete evidence of how the virus responds to this altered form of vaccines.
This changed form of the corona virus is getting out of hand, said Matt Hancock, the UK's health secretary.
Patients infected with this altered structure have also been found in Denmark, the Netherlands, and Italy.
The manner in which flights to and from the UK have been suspended suggests the risk of the virus is high, said Gavin Lee, the BBC's Brussels correspondent.
The European Union's drug regulatory body Pfizer Bioentech has signs that it will allow the use of the vaccine in 27 states.
A meeting of The European Medicines Agency has been called for a week.
If the use of the vaccine gets the green light at this meeting, the distribution of the vaccine may start in some states.

Corona virus: One out of every 10 people in the world is infected - WHO
1 in 10 people in the world may be infected with corona: WHOPHOTO SOURCE,ROBIN UTRECHT / SOPA IMAGES / LIGHTROCKET VIA GETTY IM
The World Health Organization estimates that one in 10 people in the world is infected with the corona virus.
So far, more than 3.5 million people in more than 150 countries around the world have been infected with the corona virus. 
Experts have long said that the actual number is much higher than the number of reported cases of infection
The meeting, which took place at the WHO headquarters in Geneva, discussed how to eradicate this global pandemic from countries around the world.
The first case of coronavirus infection was reported in Wuhan, China. 
A second wave of epidemics erupted in some countries after restrictions were lifted to prevent a global outbreak. 
Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergency Program, estimates that 10 percent of the world's population has been infected so far. 
But that means a large group around the world is in danger.
The virus has affected different countries around the world and everyone should come together to fight the global epidemic, said Tedros Adenhom Gibraeus, director general of the World Health Organization.
He said: "Although all countries are infected with the virus, we need to keep in mind that the outbreak is more severe in some places and less so in some places.
The virus has killed more than 1 million people so far, according to Johns Hopkins University.

Manmohan Singh's advice to Narendra Modi
Given the growing prevalence of corona in India, former Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh has sent a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi giving him 5 pieces of advice to fight the Corona.
Many states in India are facing shortage of health facilities like hospital beds, oxygen facilities etc.
Dr. The letter, written by Manmohan Singh, mainly focuses on the issue of vaccination.
Over the past year, many parents have not seen their children living in other cities, grandchildren have not seen their grandchildren, teachers have not seen their children at school, many have lost their lives and millions have been plunged back into poverty, he said.
On the one hand, while expressing concern in the country, Dr. Manmohan Singh further said, "I want to give some suggestions to fight this health crisis."
Dr. Dr. Rasa c gave these 5 tips?
1) How to plan vaccines ?
The central government should disclose how many doses have been ordered from different vaccine companies and how many vaccines have been approved for delivery for the next six months.
If you want to vaccinate a certain number of people in the future, you should already have a number of vaccine doses.
2) Coordination between Central Government and State Government
The government should indicate how the potential supply of vaccines will be distributed among the states according to a transparent formula.
The central government can set aside 10 per cent for vaccines in case of emergency, but in addition, the states should be made clear so that they can plan accordingly.
3) Explain the definition of frontline workers
States should be given some concessions so that they can create a category of frontline workers.
4) A licensing provision should be applied
In the last few decades, India has emerged as the largest vaccine producer.
Vaccine
This will enable them to increase production facilities.
5) Vaccines should be imported
Due to limited domestic supplies, imports of vaccines approved by the European Medical Agency or USFDA should be permitted.
We are facing an unprecedented emergency situation.
Remdesivir: Will not tolerate pressure on police, Valse Patil warns Fadnavis
The supply of Remedesivir injection to Maharashtra is currently heating up politics.
Noting that Devendra Fadnavis visited the BKC police station yesterday, Home Minister Walse Patil said that if pressure was put on the police, it would not be tolerated. Replying to him, Devendra Fadnavis said that it is inappropriate to do politics at present.
What happened yesterday
Mumbai Police has received information that Daman-based Bruck Pharma has a stock of 60,000 remediesvir.
Then on Saturday (April 17), Mumbai police suddenly arrested Rajesh Dokania, owner of Brooke Pharma Company.
Home Minister Dilip Walse Patil said that it was not appropriate to put pressure on the police and such things would not be tolerated in the future.
Police have received information that about 50,000 Remedesivirs are coming to Mumbai.
Walse Patil further said, "If the police wanted to investigate a case, they could have called anyone.
Speaking to the media on the occasion, Fadnavis said, "It is unfortunate, serious and worrisome that the Maharashtra government has suddenly arrested a Brooke Pharma official while we are trying our best to get Remedesivir to Maharashtra.
It's completely incomprehensible that a minister's OSD calls in the afternoon and threatens and asks how you can give Remedesivir at the behest of the opposition, and in the evening 10 policemen arrest him.
Fadnavis further said, "It is very serious if politics is taking place at such a dirty level when the Union Minister himself told the company to give more and more remedivisers to Maharashtra while taking permission from Maharashtra and Daman."
' A of the two opposition leaders to save the businessman? '
Responding to Fadnavis' allegations, Minorities Minister Nawab Malik said, "After the ban on export of remedesivir, some companies came to the Maharashtra government to allow us to sell.
A company called Brooke Pharma and its owner Rajesh Dokania were also approached by Food and Drug Administration Minister Dr. Rajendra Shingane met with Leader of Opposition Praveen Darekar.
Permission was sought from two companies, BDR and Brooke Pharma, and it was granted to them last night.
Opposition leaders Devendra Fadnavis, Praveen Darekar and Prasad Lad reached the police station at 11.30 pm.
We will bring it and distribute it in the state
What do the police say?
There is a shortage of remedicavir and it is known to cause black market.
Mumbai Police acted in good faith, the director was called for questioning.
Allegations from Remedesivir
NCP spokesperson and minister Nawab Malik on Saturday (April 17) accused the central government of ordering companies not to give Remedesivir to Maharashtra.
He said, "When the Maharashtra government asked about 16 exporting companies about Remedesivir, they got shocking information.
In today's scenario, the Maharashtra government will have no choice but to confiscate the stock of remedicivir from these companies and deliver it to the needy, Malik said.
Maharashtra BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhyay has refuted Malik's allegations.
Keshav Upadhyay said, "Instead of making such baseless allegations, Nawab Malik should give evidence if he has any, otherwise he should apologize.
Is the allegation made by Nawab Malik the role of the Maharashtra government?
BJP leader and Union Minister Piyush Goyal has tweeted that Maharashtra is suffering from the effects of inefficient and corrupt government in the state.
He wrote in his tweet, "Maharashtra is getting all the help it needs from the Center.
I am saddened to see Uddhav Thackeray playing the game of oxygen.
Maharashtra Covid Task Force issues letter regarding Ramdesivir
Maharashtra Covid Task Force has issued a letter regarding the use of Remedesivir.
Ramdesivir has received emergency permission for use against Covid-19.

Corona: How did the outbreak of corona occur in a village famous for its sex and fun?
Cape D'Agade in France is a traditional summer vacation destination for nature lovers and thousands of swingers in Europe.
France is once again witnessing a large increase in the number of coronaviruses.
It is home to one of the largest nature resorts in Europe.
As many as 30% of the 800 tourists tested corona by these mobile testing units tested positive.
'We all know why we're here'
There is a big resort called 'village naturiste' not far from the main city.
Of course not all nature lovers are swingers.
A swinger couple told the BBC: "Everyone here is very close to each other all day and of course naked."
We all know why we're here.
About 45,000 tourists visit here every day in summer.
However, this situation predates Covid.
How did the corona erupt?
At the end of August, two employees of 'Village Naturiste' were found to be covid positive.
The hotel owner has admitted that he had organized a party on the terrace of a hotel here.
David Masella, manager of Village Naturiste, told the BBC: "We were hit twice.
Most of these tourists did not return this year due to the virus infection.
One thing you should note is that our village has ten thousand campsite pitches.
Local administration response
The French health administration says there are four times as many cases in Cape de-Agade than in the surrounding area.
However, the staff here said that none of them needed to be admitted to the hospital immediately.
In Cape D'Agde, as in the rest of the world, it is mandatory to wear a face mask in every city and town.
I met two couples in the evening. They live here.
The couple, who are in their forties, met a few years ago at a swingers' club in Bordeaux, France.
Two employees of the hotel have contracted corona.
The village turned from a magic location into a tragic location overnight.
'More young people at risk'
Allen and his wife were sitting in front of me.
Both have crossed for ages. He says it is wrong to blame any one village.
At our age, of course, we have to be careful about where we go, who we come in contact with.
Many clubs and bars where physical contact was more prevalent were immediately shut down as corona infections became more prevalent.
Vicky Beach Resort was also closed.
Le Glamor Nightclub is also very popular among tourists.
The closure of these parties caused a lot of frustration.
'No one is in the mood to have fun'
Philip Barre has been running a clothing store for the past 30 years.
Speaking to the BBC, Philip said: "We are very important to the local economy.
There are only 5,000 people here today.
Although Philip says that the swingers I met said that although the corona erupted, the swingers activity did not stop completely.
This suffix also comes when you go to the beach.
Many of these are over the age of fifty. However, the desire to look attractive has not diminished.
In the evenings, many are seen dressed in sexy outfits at the open-air bar on the beach.
The crowd is much smaller than before.
The administration has also suggested that those who are thinking of returning home should return only after undergoing a covid test.
When will the corona vaccine arrive?
A patient infected with the corona was first found in Wuhan, China, in December last year.
It then began to spread to other parts of the world.
So far in nine months, the corona virus has crossed the 2.66 million mark.
The death toll from the virus has risen to more than 8.75 million.
In August, Russia announced the discovery of a vaccine against Kovid-19.
He has named this vaccine 'Sputnik V'.
But coronavirus vaccines are being developed in many countries around the world.
Another 142 companies are developing vaccines, according to the World Health Organization .
According to Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist at the World Health Organization, the vaccine, developed by Oxford University, is being manufactured by AstraZeneca.
The BBC's health and science correspondent James Gallagher says "the vaccine for the corona virus will be available by mid-2021 .
News of the coronavirus vaccine has created a ray of hope in the minds of ordinary citizens, including scientists .
This question has made many people nervous.
AstraZeneca vaccine
The BBC spoke to AstraZeneca, a company that produces vaccines manufactured by Oxford University.
We will try to make the vaccine available at a lower cost.
Last month, the head of the company in Mexico said, "In Latin America, a single dose of vaccine can cost less than four dollars.
The Serum Institute , which is the largest producer of the vaccine in India , said the price of the vaccine for India as well as other developing countries could be around or Rs 220.
Similarly, in Europe , it can cost up to two and a half euros , according to the Italian Ministry of Health.
Australia also signed an agreement with AstraZeneca for the corona vaccine in August.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said it is unclear how much the corona vaccine will be given to all Australians.
Vaccine by Sanofi Pasteur
In France, the vaccine can cost up to 10 euros per dose (about 900 rupees), said Olivier Bogilot, head of the Sanofi company, on Saturday.
Pharmaceutical manufacturers and government agencies around the world are working to develop vaccines to combat corona.
AstraZeneca is considered a major competitor to Sanofi.
Speaking about the low cost of the AstraZeneca vaccine, Bogilot says, "It matters what resources you use.
Vaccine from Cyanoform, a Chinese company
Cyanoform, a Chinese company, is also developing the vaccine, its head Liu Jingzhen said last month.
When the vaccine became available in the market, two doses of it could cost less than one thousand Chinese yuan (ten thousand rupees), he had said.
But experts say health workers and students should be vaccinated for free.
According to Chinese medical officials, if the vaccine is included in the national vaccination campaign, the vaccine could be obtained at government expense.
Liu, currently the head of the company, has taken two doses of the vaccine.
Modern vaccine
The Modernna company in Cambridge is also trying to make vaccines.
The vaccine can be given to some people at a cost of ते 33 to37 in the wake of the Corona outbreak, Modern said.
The price of the vaccine could be kept as low as possible, said CEO Stephen Bansel.
The current times are difficult and everyone should get this vaccine.
Pfizer vaccine
In July this year, the US government signed a 1.97 billion deal with Pfizer and Bioentech for the corona vaccine.
According to a report published in FirePharma , Pfizer and Biantech are developing an MRNA-based corona vaccine.
Anyone will need two initial doses of vaccine and one booster dose.
Corona-era organic waste endangers your health?
The problem of bio-medical waste generated across the state during the period of Covid-19 is likely to become very serious.
PPE kits, masks, goggles and other items are used daily to treat patients in the fight against corona virus.
Exposure to these substances also increases the risk of contracting the disease.
As a result, the Corona crisis has seen an increase in the number of biomedical wastes generated in the state by thousands of kilos.
Biological waste situation in the state
The state announced a lockdown in March.
There has been a significant increase in the amount of organic waste generated in the state since the corona.
According to the State Pollution Control Board, the state used to generate 62.3 tonnes (62,300 kg) of organic waste per day before Covid-19, while the number of organic waste reached 90.6 tonnes (90,600 kg) during the Corona period.
Organic waste generation increased by 45 percent
Increased organic waste generation in lockdown ...
10 percent (6.5 tons) in Lockdown 1
15 percent (10 tons) in Lockdown 2
30 (20 tons) in Lockdown 3
In Lockdown 4, organic waste generation increased by 45 percent
(Source-State Pollution Control Board Report)
The disposal of biological medical waste caused by Covid-19 is of utmost importance for the municipalities and districts in the years to come, the report said.
The problem of organic waste in Mumbai
In Mumbai too, the number of organic wastes has suddenly increased during the Corona period.
Ashok Yamagar, chief engineer of the solid waste management department, told the BBC:
Information on Covid-19 organic waste in Mumbai
In March, an average of 286 kg of organic waste was collected daily
In April, the quantity increased to 3750 kg
In May, an average of 7900 kg of organic waste was generated per day
More than 10,000 kg of organic waste was generated per day in June
More than 12,000 kg of organic waste generated in July
So, on September 13, 11,719 kg of organic waste was collected.

Biological medical waste poses a threat to public health
Mumbai Municipal Corporation has given the responsibility of disposal of bio-waste generated in Mumbai to a private company based in Govandi.
The company is located in a densely populated area.
Saif Alam, who is a lawyer by profession in Govandi area, is suffering from allergic bronchitis.
Saif says, We have issued a legal notice to the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board.
"All of Mumbai's biomedical waste is brought to this place for disposal.
Why doesn't the corporation set up more than one plant for disposal of medical waste?
When asked about the pollution allegations against the company, Ashok Yamagar, the chief engineer of the corporation, refrained from giving a direct answer.
The company can dispose of up to 24 metric tonnes of waste. It is a common treatment facility center.
The issue came up in the rainy session
The Samajwadi Party had raised the issue of biomedical waste in the Assembly during the two-day monsoon session in September.
Pollution has reduced people's life expectancy from 60 to 39.
The situation of bio-medical waste in Kolhapur is also critical.
Dilip Desai, a social worker from Kolhapur, said, "The biomedical waste disposal plant in the city is sometimes closed and sometimes operational.
The State Pollution Control Board has issued a show cause notice to the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation.
The challenge of organic waste disposal
According to the State Pollution Board, in 2019, 62.13 metric tons of organic waste was disposed of per day.
Challenges Facing Organic Waste Disposal
Not getting trained people to work
Improper segregation of waste
PPE kits reduce the capacity of the machine
Sunil Dandwate, vice-president of the All India Biomedical Waste Association, said, Normally, machines are designed for a specific type of waste.
The issue of transportation is also important.
Central Government Information on Organic Waste
In August, Union Health Minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey said in a written reply to the Rajya Sabha that the country generated 169 tonnes of organic waste per day during the Covid-19 period.
Informing the Rajya Sabha, Health Minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey said, "According to the Central Pollution Control Board, there have been some complaints about improper disposal of organic waste.
At the same time, there have been complaints of improper segregation of items in coronary artery treatment centers and hospitals.
An app has been developed to monitor the proper disposal of bio-waste generated by covid.
Expert opinion
Speaking on the issue of biological medical waste, Dr. RNisarg of the social organization working on the topic of waste management.
Therefore, along with Covid-19, the waste generated in the hospital will also increase.
"PPE kits are in high demand in medical waste generated by Covid-19.
Proper segregation of covid and routine waste should be done.
What do the workers say about the Union Minister's statement on 'migration due to fake news'?
Union Home Minister Nityanand Rai had said in the Lok Sabha on September 15 that fake news came after the lockdown and thousands of workers marched to their homes due to fears created by the fake news.
After the lockdown, thousands of migrant workers fled their homes.
Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai said, "Fear spread over the fake news about the lockdown period, which led to a mass exodus of migrant workers.
However, in times of unavoidable lockdown, the central government was vigilant to ensure that no one was deprived of basic necessities like food, drinking water, health care and took necessary steps to meet these needs. "
The BBC spoke to the migrant workers after the central government made the statement in Parliament.
What do migrant workers have to say?
The migration of workers had already started in India a few days before the lockdown.
Before the lockdown, only a couple of laborers were seen on the streets carrying their belongings and children.
Even after the reversal of June and July, many people were seen traveling in trucks or other similar large vehicles in an inhumane manner.
Representatives of the BBC walked with many of these workers to convey their grievances to readers.
After the statement of Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai, some of these workers once again explained why they left the city and returned to their village.
Pooja says, "There was nothing left to eat in my room.
Pooja Kumari, who lives in Delhi with her husband, will never be able to forget what she suffered during the lockdown.
We said okay. After that, no grain was received.
I mean, I was not allowed to go for dinner.
There was nothing in the room to eat.
We told them why go back to the room?
After that, Pooja Kumari and her husband returned to their home in Jharkhand after overcoming many difficulties by the special train started at that time.
Vimala Devi has a similar story.
She says, "We left there (Delhi) when we didn't have any work.
There was no way to get home.
However, some of the laborers walking home are unhappy with the media and the system.
Manoj Singh, who left Delhi on foot with Ranveer Singh, who died on foot, is not ready to talk about it.
Sittu Kumar, who had experienced migration clicks, had gone to Delhi from Bihar in search of work a few days before the lockdown.
He even got a job in Delhi. However, just two days after the work began, the lockdown began.
Sittu Kumar says, "The work was stopped there.
Only two days worked and the lockdown started.
These are the stories of a handful of migrant laborers who returned to their hometowns after losing their jobs and lacking food and water.
Returning to Delhi, Salman says, "I used to live in Bawana.
We had nothing to eat or drink when we left.
Corona Maharashtra: Are ventilators dusting in many places in the state?
The effect of having ventilators, but not in use, is serious.
He adds, "This means you can only take care of 2 patients.
Herschel himself was cowardly positive and was also admitted for some time.
It was reported that 25 ventilators were lying unused in Kovid Center in Chandwad taluka of Nashik district.
In July, it was found that the ventilators provided by an organization in Pune were not being used.
Around the same time, the BJP had alleged that 400 ventilators provided by the PM Care Fund were lying in a Mumbai hospital .
While replying to this, Mumbai Municipal Corporation Mayor Kishori Pednekar had denied the allegation that 'ventilators are eating dust'.
This was followed by reports of similar incidents in Nanded .
But the latest incident is that 25 ventilators provided by PM Care Fund are lying unused in Chandwad taluka sub-district hospital in Nashik district this week.
"A few days ago, when I visited the hospital, I noticed that 25 ventilators were literally eating away at the dust.
Of course, local health officials, doctors and medical staff are constantly working, but they say it is an administrative mistake.
The de-humidifier required for the ventilator was not here, there is a shortage of manpower.
What about the lives of ordinary people?
This is the subject of Herschel's attention. "I was admitted.
If the oxygen saturation of the covid patient admitted in the taluka hospital goes below 75-80, they are immediately referred to the district hospital.
In all this, the patient's important time is wasted.
In such a situation, patients are often frightened and assume that they will not read, says Herschel.
Hershel says, "When I was admitted, there was a householder next to me.
And he died the next evening after being taken to Nashik.
The population of Chandwad taluka is around two and a half lakh.
Nowadays 10-12 positive patients are found there every day while one case has to be referred to Nashik District Hospital as critical every day.
Even if they are taken to a district location, there is no guarantee that they will get a bed.
Nashik district has received about 200 ventilators in the last few months through PM Care Fund and CSR Activities.
Misunderstandings of the people
Corona proliferation in India has accelerated over the past few weeks, with the number of patients in rural areas increasing rapidly.
People think that testing in government hospitals will be positive and we will get caught in that cycle.
PM Care Fund
Most of the leaders who allege that the ventilators are lying are from the BJP and they say that these ventilators were provided from the PM Care Fund.
Information about PM Care Fund should be given on the website.
Both the state government relief fund and the PM care fund are discriminated against.
However, the most important question is whether the common man is not involved in the political and administrative differences between the state and central governments.
Corona Oxygen: Is India's situation with Corona getting worse than before?
Ankit Sethia was wandering around a 50-bed hospital in Bhiwandi near Mumbai on Friday night, anxiously waiting for oxygen.
Ankit Sethia's SS Hospital and Research Center had only two of the four oxygen cylinders filled.
The hospital has 44 out of 50 beds.
As the patient grows, the small oxygen tank runs out in six hours.
Ankit always buys oxygen from those who are not currently supplied.
He made overnight inquiries at about 10 suppliers and four hospitals in and around Mumbai.
Finally, at two in the morning, they learned that 20 large oxygen cylinders were available at a hospital. But the hospital was 30 kilometers long.
Since there was no vehicle available to bring oxygen, they sent an ambulance for the job.
All the cylinders were brought from that place in five rounds.
Now four employees have been assigned to search for the oxygen cylinder and make it available immediately.
Ankit said on Sunday, "Now I have oxygen for the next 12 hours.
According to the World Health Organization, 15 percent of patients infected with corona need oxygen for artificial respiration.
Some patients come in without any complaints related to breathing.
Oxygen production is done in 500 factories in the country.
Factories produce liquid oxygen and fill it in a tank.
Steel and aluminum cylinders are also used in some hospitals.
People are now returning to work after the country's lockdown was lifted.
So far, 5 million people have been infected with the corona in India, which ranks second in terms of the number of patients.
In the last one week alone, India has seen an increase of six lakh patients.
In such a situation, the demand for oxygen will increase, which is natural.
Hospitals and care centers are using 2,700 tonnes of oxygen this month.
This information has been obtained from the All India Industrial Gas Manufacturers Association.
The highest number of patients in the country are from Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.
The question of life and death versus stomach
At present in India, there is a situation of life and death versus water.
According to Saket Tikku, president of the Manufacturers Association, "Currently 45 per cent of oxygen is being used for industry and 55 per cent for hospitals.
If you reduce the supply in the factory, the industry will suffer.
Most of the oxygen factories in India are located near cities as well as large villages.
Nothing has been achieved even by controlling the price of oxygen.
There is no solution even after government intervention
Saket Tikku says, "The government has set a limit on the price of oxygen cylinders, but not of liquid oxygen.
So far, 82,000 patients have died of corona in India.
Last week, four corona patients died in Madhya Pradesh due to lack of oxygen.
The death toll of 70 children in Uttar Pradesh in August 2017 is still fresh.
Oxygen is depleted in Madhya Pradesh.
Piyush Bhatt, who has been running the refilling company for five years, says, "The demand for oxygen cylinders in the district has quadrupled since last month."
Fear of a situation similar to Italy
Piyush says, "We could not get the supply as the truck was stopped at the state border.
Even on Monday, Piyush was waiting for the supply.
Dr. of Glory Hospital in Chhindwara.
The 960-bed AIIMS hospital in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, is slowly filling up.
We are providing oxygen from various places by doing wire exercises, said N.S. R. Bishnoi said.
So, Bhiwandi Ankit Sethia is also getting calls from others for oxygen.
Five patients would have died if they had not received the cylinder in half an hour, he says.
Will everything be fine overnight with the corona vaccine?
If you think that everything will be fine with the corona vaccine, you may be wrong.
The vaccine is currently being looked at in such a way that all coronary outbreaks will end immediately.
Scientists say it could take at least a year for the vaccine to reach people.
Vaccine trials are currently underway in 200 locations around the world.
Dr. of the National Heart and Lung Institute of Imperial College London.
Many, including scientific advisers to the UK government, hope that the vaccine will be ready by the end of this year and that it will be heavily tested.
Assuming the vaccine is ready, it doesn't mean everyone will be vaccinated in a month.
It is unthinkable that all will be well until March.
Of course, some experimental methods are also being used.
What are the difficulties along the way?
Raw materials are needed to make the vaccine.
Pvt. According to Shah, "Corona needs to work ten times faster than it does every year to eradicate the common flu.
Preliminary tests of some of the vaccines showed that they boosted the immune system.
Many questions remain unanswered
We don't really know when the vaccine will be made.
He goes on to say, "If this were possible, things would get better as soon as possible.
Also, some questions remain unanswered regarding vaccines
Will a single shot of vaccine be enough or will another booster dose be needed?
Will it be equally effective on older people?
Speaking about this, Dr. of the University of Bath.
He said that in order to get all the information about vaccination, a 'vaccine passport' would have to be prepared for the people coming and going in the country.
He says there has also been a rise in tensions over the corona vaccine.
Many such questions remain unresolved.
Is the spread of Corona virus slowing down in India?
After 65 lakh corona cases and 1 lakh deaths, is the spread of corona virus slowing down in India?
In India, an average of 64,000 coronaviruses are found every day this month.
Earlier in September alone, there were an average of 93,000 cases per day.
There should be 70,000 tests every day in August.
Looking at these statistics, it seems that the number of corona victims is decreasing.
There are positive signs that the number of coronaries is declining.
He says that increasing the number of tests and decreasing the number of patients is not enough to reach any conclusion.
They are quick and effective. However, their credibility is also low.
In contrast, the RT-PCR test is more reliable.
Speaking to the BBC, virologist Dr. Shahid Jalil said, "It is difficult to say whether the number of coronaviruses is declining due to erroneous results of rapid testing and indeed the incidence of infection is declining."
According to him, only if the government provides statistics on the total number of PCR tests and how many rapid tests have been done, can it be said for sure.
The President of Public Health Foundation of India, Dr. According to Srinath Reddy, on-demand testing has started in India.
A professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the University of Michigan, Dr. According to Bhramar Mukherjee, 12 to 13 crore people in India have been infected with the corona virus so far. T
Various antigen tests in India have so far shown that 90 million people have been infected with the corona.
Dr. Mukherjee says, "Compared to the spread of the virus, there is still a lot of forest left to spread.
But how do you know if the corona virus has slowed down in India?
Dr. According to Reddy, this can be estimated by getting death statistics.
Although the number of coronaviruses appears to be declining, the 7-day moving average of deaths indicates that the spread of the virus is declining.
Adam Kacharsky, a scientist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says that any global health crisis has four stages - spark, growth, peak and decline.
In the UK, when the swine flu outbreak hit in 2009, it increased in the summer, with its peak in July.
Let's take the example of countries with a large number of Kovid-19 patients - USA, UK, Russia and France.
Dr. Mukherjee says that while the picture is reassuring, it is "fleeting and short-lived".
He says, "These (declining numbers of patients) are not a sign that the disease is getting under control or a matter of consolation.
So tie one thing - use a mask, wash your hands constantly and stay away from crowded places.
Corona: Why do experts around the world say that vaccines alone are not enough?
Efforts to find a vaccine on Covid-19 are currently at the level of clinical trials.
There is no point in just finding a vaccine for any disease.
The process of producing vaccines in a factory is very different from the process of making vaccines in a laboratory.
Millions of doses of vaccines for measles, mumps, rubella and even influenza are produced in factories every year.
Developing a new vaccine is a long process.
However, clinical trials of the vaccine began after the outbreak of Ebola.
Experts say that developing a completely new vaccine nationally or globally without compromising the production of existing vaccines is a daunting task.
Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University's Center for Infection and Immunity, says, "We are developing a vaccine on a virus that has never been vaccinated before, never approved. Not used extensively. "
It usually takes 10 years for a vaccine to be developed and reach the masses.
At the heart of this effort is the parallel development process being used by the pharmaceutical industry in times of crisis.
After successfully passing all these stages, it goes for final approval and then the factory starts mass production of vaccine.
In the case of the Covid-19 vaccine, however, many of these stages continue in parallel.
For example, after testing on animals, the exact dose of vaccine to be used for a clinical trial is decided.
Margaret Liu, head of the International Society for Vaccines, said: "We are currently examining the results of tests performed on animals that have already begun clinical trials of the third phase of the vaccine."
Although vaccines have not yet been developed as part of this parallel development process, manufacturing facilities are being set up around the world.
The United States has launched Operation Warp Speed ​​for the production of vaccines.
When any vaccine is produced in a factory, laboratory methods of vaccine preparation are not used.
The same problem occurs when any vaccine is produced in large quantities.
And so even for large-scale production of vaccines, a different process has to be followed.
Dean says, "Even during factory production, there are many stages of trial and error and therefore it takes a long time to reach the stage of getting the right return."
Moreover, no technology for vaccine production has been used so extensively before.
In addition, everyone will need to be given two doses of the vaccine to prevent covid-19.
Taking a single dose of the vaccine can have side effects.
Liu says, "People who have low levels of antibodies are no longer at risk of disease, assuming they don't follow the rules of social distance or the use of masks in public places.
Some vaccines require special equipment for use.
The device is the size of a small electric toothbrush.
Although these devices can be used more than once, they must be produced in sufficient quantities.
Some other items are needed along with the vaccine.
Even for Covid-19 vaccines, these small bottles will have to be mass-produced.
One solution could be a multi-dose vaccine vial that can store more than one dose of vaccine.
Therefore, it is as important to make a vaccine as it is to keep it safe and maintain its quality.
Such low temperatures are usually only possible in laboratories.
To solve this problem of refrigerators, distribution companies like UPS and DHL are opening freezer farms around the world.
Liu says, "Some companies are also developing monitors for vaccine capsules to monitor the temperature.
Also, there is a problem called 'Last Mile Problem' or 'Last Mile Issue'.
We can hope that the most needy will get this vaccine by early 2021.
This is a huge challenge. However, given the unprecedented global collective effort for the Covid-19 vaccine, it remains to be seen whether we will meet this challenge.
Corona Vaccine: After losing a close friend, he took the initiative for testing
Anil Hebber's close friend, who lived in Mumbai in September, died of Covid-19.
Anil Hebber owns a medical device manufacturing company.
However, this was not the only friend Anil Hebber lost due to Covid-19.
I was shocked by his death.
Anil Hebber registered earlier this month for testing in India a vaccine being developed jointly by AstraZeneca and Oxford University.
Efforts are underway to develop a vaccine against a simple cold virus that infects chimpanzees.
Today, research is underway on about 180 Covid-19 vaccines worldwide.
More than 20,000 volunteers have participated in clinical trials of Oxford vaccine in the UK, Brazil, South Africa and India.
The number of corona victims in India is over 70 lakh.
These tests will test whether the vaccine activates the body's immune system against the virus and whether the vaccine has any side effects on the body.
However, it was not easy for Anil Hebber to decide to take part in the test.
His wife, a professor of developmental studies at the College of Social Sciences, did not like the decision.
Not only that, but the worldwide trials were suspended for some time due to the ill health of two volunteers in the UK.
However, Anil Heber insisted on his decision.
At the beginning of October, he called the hospital in Mumbai where the second and third phases of the vaccine were being tested.
The next morning he went to the hospital.
That same night, they received a phone call from the hospital informing them that they could participate in the test.
The next day, the doctor gave them detailed information about how they would pass the test.
Doctors said three of the 55 vaccinated had mild fever.
Heber says, "The whole process was very easy and painless.
Anil Hebber, who took the initiative for vaccine testing, has done a lot of work for corona sufferers throughout the lockdown.
The lockdown began in India in the last week of March.
It was a very frightening situation and the lockdown was implemented in a very wrong way, he says.
Anil Hebber says, "During all this time, I must have driven about 28,000 km in and around Mumbai.
During this time I wandered in the slums.
Anil Hebber has registered his name for the test.
This global health crisis has been a life-changing experience for me.
Corona Women's Health: 29 lakh 50 thousand women in India can have 'unwanted pregnancy'?
Stress on government machinery during the Covid period has affected family planning facilities.
It does not include family planning operations performed by government hospitals.
A teacher couple living in a rural area of ​​Maharashtra had to go through a lot of mental stress in the lockdown.
During the investigation, it was learned that the second month has started in May.
He inquired at a nearby primary health center.
Doctors at the primary health center advised her to go to a government-approved private abortion center.
Many families have secrets about abortion.
'25 thousand loans and interest 18 thousand '
The 21-year-old from a similar but poor family had an unwanted pregnancy.
Women's Health: Why take a loan from a lender for abortion in a private hospital?
She was advised by the primary health center to have an abortion in the fifth month.
The sonography cost more than Rs 5,000.
The nearest primary health center used to check pregnant women on the ninth of every month till February.
Eventually, the woman paid Rs 25,000 to a private hospital for abortion surgery.
Where did you get this amount? When asked, she said, "I took a loan of Rs 25,000 from a lender.
This means that the family will have to pay interest of Rs 18,000 on a loan of Rs 25,000 a year.
The recent heavy rains have also damaged the crop.
Covid's crisis has put a strain on the health care system, putting a strain on the government health system.
These are two representative examples.
Unwanted pregnancy
If this situation continues for a few more days, there will be 18 lakh abortions in India, of which 10 lakh 40 thousand abortions will be unsafe and nearly two thousand mothers may die in pregnancy, according to a report by the Foundation for Reproductive Health Services, India (FRHSI). .
If medical family planning services in India do not resume as before by 2020, women's health will deteriorate, the report said.
Contraceptives will not be available to 2 crore 71 lakh 80 thousand couples in the country and therefore 29 lakh 50 thousand women will have to accept unwanted pregnancies, the organization said.
The institute has analyzed how Covid will affect family planning in India.
Abortion is dangerous and expensive
In India, abortion is allowed within 20 weeks.
Abortion facilities are usually available in the first 12 weeks.
In the current situation, if you want to go to the operating theater to terminate the pregnancy, it is inevitable to test Covid.
According to him, 'the government health system in India was in shambles, it has come to light only because of Kovid.
'Demand for contraceptives increases'
Last year, in the financial year 2019-20, 3 lakh 66 thousand 205 family planning surgeries were performed in Maharashtra.
As a contraceptive, 'Antra' injection facility is provided by the government hospital.
Exactly how many family planning surgeries have been performed in Maharashtra since April 2020 and how many contraceptive devices have been used has not been released yet.
But you can get an idea from the statistics of Osmanabad district.
At the same time, a positive change has taken place.
He also said that women's health rights have been neglected as all the poor and middle income families are dependent on government family planning programs.
It will be important to see the Total Fertility Rate (TFA) in the country in the near future.
What will happen to a woman's right to abortion during Kovid's time and will her life be safe?
Corona: Thousands gather in Bihar as epidemic spreads
Restrictions on coronation are not being observed in Bihar at present.
The video shows people flocking to these meetings of all parties to see their leader.
The participants did not even wear masks.
The Election Commission has made the leaders aware of the rules made against Kovid-19.
Violation of corona safety regulations
Virologist Dr. According to Shahid Jameel, political parties need to be more responsible, they should also make their activists aware.
He said, "Thousands of people seem to be participating in these campaigns.
In Bihar, the BJP and JD (U) are trying to regain power.
A journalist from Bihar says that no one is talking about Corona in the campaign.
He said, "Corona seems to have suddenly disappeared from the state.
The state government has said that 1.5 lakh tests are being conducted every day.
But experts are not convinced.
Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had said that two lakh people are being tested in the state every day.
According to experts, this condition is a risk factor for rapid antigen misinformation.
Pulmonologist Dr. A. Fatehuddin says, "Such violations are unaffordable in Bihar.
He says, "Bihar has a high population density.
The festive season and the weather can also be linked to the spread of the corona.
Dr. Shahid Jameel says, "I am horrified to see such photos of campaign rallies, cold days and the coming festive season.
Dr. "There is a widespread perception among young people that the corona does not have much effect, but we cannot guarantee that young people will not be seriously ill with the virus," says Fatahuddin.
If people in other parts of the country see this crowd, they may feel that the virus is no longer spreading and that the risk is greater.
Corona: Why didn't the gym start?
There were a lot of restrictions on the gym during the Corona period, some places still are.
During the Corona period, most businesses closed due to lockdowns.
Gyms were started in the UK.
The ban on gymnasiums in the UK does not apply to the whole country.
What are the reasons behind closing the gym?
Gymnasiums have been shut down on the one hand to keep the government fit on the other to prevent corona.
Gym users told Newsbeat that the decision to close the gym was incomprehensible.
What does the scripture say?
Jonathan Ball, a professor at the University of Nottingham, is well versed in the virus.
Exercising causes your body to move a lot.
So while exercising, droplets can come out of the sneeze or talk.
Many equipments, objects are contacted while exercising in the gym.
But there is a solution.
The risk of corona infection in the gym can be carefully reduced.
Looking at the data from the Department of Public Health in England, I don't know if the gym centers have become a hotspot for corona.
If there are strict restrictions on the gym, then the government and the scientists should explain the reasons behind the strict restrictions.
The government and the local administration are working hard to prevent overcrowding in places where corona can be transmitted.
So some restrictions may seem unwarranted to citizens.
Economic consequences are seen as less risky in terms of losses.
What do gym drivers say?
I'm shocked, confused, confused by this decision, said trainer Nathan Penman.
We all have strange feelings.
The 28-year-old from Liverpool spoke to Newsbeat after the gym session.
Not everyone will understand why gyms are closing.
Nathan said it is important to use the gym for physical and mental health.
Health and fitness, including physical and mental health, should be a priority for every country.
Therefore, the closure of gyms started by the government sends the wrong message to the society.
Everyone who came to the gym had to follow the rules, Nathan said.
The number of corona patients is increasing in the Nottingham area.
I was eager to go to the gym.
The staff at the gym had taken all measures to prevent corona infection.
However, he said that many gym members were not following the rules.
Many members did not wipe it off after using the equipment in the gym.
I go for swimming to keep my mental health good and not to have negative thoughts in my head.
You have to register for the time before going to our gym.
So Jack has decided to go to the gym at least once.
Corona Vaccine: Why is it necessary for Indians to develop a 'hot vaccine' for corona?
Temperatures reach 50 degrees Celsius in many places in India during summer days.
All vaccines are transported and distributed at temperatures as low as 2 to 8 degrees Celsius.
However, Covid-19 developed a vaccine that does not depend on cold temperatures, does not need to be stored in cold storage, and can be delivered to remote areas at any temperature.
Some researchers in India are trying to develop such a vaccine.
Raghavan Varadarajan is a biophysicist and professor at the Indian Institute of Science.
Pvt. "The vaccine has had good results," says Varadarajan.
The Secretary of the Biotechnology Department of the Center, Dr. "I hope this research will open up new avenues for funding for this vaccine, which does not require a coldstorage chain," says Renu Swaroop.
Vaccines that survive high temperatures are rare.
Vaccines for the three diseases of the world, namely meningitis, human paleomavirus (HPV) and cholera, are used at temperatures as high as 40 degrees Celsius.
These vaccines are delivered immediately even in remote areas, which greatly reduces the burden on health workers.
Julian Potett, Policy Advisor for the Medicines Sans Frontieres Access Campaign, says:
Large-scale vaccination campaigns require millions of doses of the vaccine to be delivered to different areas in the shortest possible time.
India is expected to receive 40 to 50 crore doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, which is expected to reach around 250 million people between January and July next year.
Vaccination program has been implemented in India for the last 42 years.
Under India's immunization program, about 39 crore doses of vaccine for various diseases are given to 55 million people every year, especially newborns and pregnant women.
India has a strong network of government-owned cold storage for vaccines to carry out such a large-scale vaccination campaign.
Coolant packs such as small freezers, ice-covered refrigerators, refrigerated trucks, dry ice and cold boxes are needed to keep the vaccine cool.
Managing Director of Blue Star, a large company in pharmaceutical cold chain products.
The Covid-19 vaccine can be classified in three ways in terms of temperature, according to the World Health Organization.
Providing cold chains for a comprehensive vaccination campaign is going to be a big challenge.
India has a cold storage capacity of 40 tonnes.
Most of our vaccine storage capacity does not meet international standards.
Although the vaccine can be stored at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius, most cold storage capacity is designed to vaccinate infants.
Andrew Taylor of the Duke Global Health Institute in the United States says, "There are many challenges that can be overcome. "
How can crackers increase the spread of corona?
The festival of Diwali has come in a few days.
Therefore, there will be many limitations on celebrating Diwali this year.
Firecrackers have been banned in many states in the country.
Every year, before Diwali, the issue of firecrackers and their pollution is discussed.
Many states, including Delhi and Rajasthan, have banned firecrackers
Covid-19 is a respiratory disease.
Firecrackers have been banned in Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, West Bengal and Odisha to curb the spread of the corona virus.
The states said the decision was taken as a precautionary measure to prevent corona infection and pose a potential threat to the health of citizens.
A decision to ban firecrackers in Maharashtra has not been taken yet.
Health Minister Rajesh Tope had recently called for a firecracker-free Diwali to reduce the death toll from corona and as a precaution against a possible second wave.
Therefore, it is being said that the Maharashtra state government is also considering banning firecrackers.
But what problems would arise if firecrackers were blown up during the Corona period?
Corona carriers will become pollutants
A study conducted in Jamshedpur had revealed that firecrackers were causing a lot of pollution during Diwali .
Firecrackers produce large amounts of smoke in the air.
During the winter, it can act as a carrier of aerosols and PM2.5 corona viruses, said Dr. Krishna Kumar, a pulmonologist at KIMS Hospital, Hyderabad.
He says, "Corona virus is a virus that spreads through the air.
High risk for patients with covidosis
The corona virus attacks the human respiratory system.
Dr. who was infected with corona.
After being cowardly, Dr. said that you are having the following problems.
To make our health as before, Dr. Khan has to undergo treatment again.
This means that people who have become cowardly may be at greater risk.
In this regard, J. of Mumbai. J. The head of the ear, nose and throat department of the hospital, Dr.
The challenge is to keep the respiratory system and immune system healthy during the corona period, he says.
Patients who have been exposed to Covid-19 for long periods of time on oxygen and ventilators have an increased risk of developing lung disease.
Asthma, an increase in asthma patients
Toxic substances like nitrogen dioxide, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, volatile compounds are released into the air from firecrackers.
Dr. According to Jain, "Firecrackers are not the only thing that affects people with respiratory problems in old age.
Oxygen levels in the human body decrease after coronavirus infection.
Dr. Jain says, "Smoke from firecrackers disturbs the air balance.
Dr. who developed the corona vaccine.
The pharmaceutical company that develops the corona vaccine, Dr. Reddy has reported a cyber attack.
The company said its websites in India, England, the US, Russia and Brazil had been hacked.
The company said it had isolated all of its data center services to prevent the attack.
Last week, Dr. Reddy's was allowed to conduct tests in the third phase of Russia's Sputnik-5 vaccine.
The company declined to comment on whether the attack affected corona vaccine production.
The company's phone lines in Yorkshire and Cambridgeshire in the UK are closed.
Mukesh Rathi, chief information officer of the company, said, "We have isolated all data center services as a precautionary measure against cyber attacks.
Corona glue
We expect all services to be restored within the next 24 hours and this incident is unlikely to have any major impact on our process.
Dr. of India. Some media outlets had said that the production of Reddy's vaccine was hampered.
Dr. Reddy's was founded in 1986 and is based in Hyderabad.
Last week, the Drug Regulatory Authority of India (DRAI) approved the company to conduct a third phase trial at the primary level.
What is the plan of Modi government to make corona vaccine available to the people?
Haryana Health Minister Anil Vij administered the dose of Kovacin vaccine.
Haryana Health Minister Anil Vij on Friday inoculated a covacin vaccine being developed on corona.
The Pune-based Serum Institute of India explained the cost of corona vaccine.
According to reports so far, it is estimated that two doses of the vaccine will be needed every two to three weeks to prevent coronary heart disease.
In the wake of all this news, discussions have started on how the corona vaccine will reach the people in the country.
Government announcement
Coronavirus vaccine will be available in the first two to three months of 2021, said Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan.
This means that the countdown to the corona vaccine has begun.
Corona Vaccine, Serum, Oxford, Modern, Pfizer
The new vaccine is claimed to be 95 percent successful, according to preliminary findings of corona vaccine tests from the American company Moderna.
Just a few days ago, the Pfizer company claimed that the vaccine could be 90 percent successful.
The University of Oxford also said on Thursday that the corona vaccine was having an effect on senior citizens.
Modern vaccines will require minus 20 degrees Celsius, while Pfizer will need minus 70 to 80 percent.
In India, a cold storage system is available for vaccination campaigns for children.
This is why the Government of India, Oxford and the country are looking into the development of the covacin vaccine.
If all goes according to schedule, the covacin vaccine will be on the market by early next year. Storage of this vaccine will not be a problem for the Government of India.
Population of India and dose of vaccine
According to the Serum Institute of India, the company is in a position to produce 50 to 60 million doses of vaccine per month.
The company has stated that by February 2021, 100 million doses of the vaccine could be produced per month.
It is not clear what the agreement is between the Government of India and the Serum Institute of India.
Adar Punawala, chief executive officer of the Serum Institute of India, said the government had demanded 100 million doses of the vaccine by July 2021.
The central government has decided to make 300 million doses of the vaccine available to the public by July 2021.
It is not yet known whether the government will take the dose of the vaccine from the Serum Institute.
We are ready to provide 300 million doses to the Indian government by July, Punawala said.
In addition, the Serum Institute is part of the ongoing Covax scheme to deliver the vaccine worldwide through the World Health Organization.
The organization is also preparing to vaccinate for this initiative.
Where will the good news for vaccines come from?
Tests on five corona vaccines are underway in India.
The Serum Institute has entered into an agreement with four vaccine manufacturers in the world other than the Oxford vaccine.
Adar Punawala gave more information in this regard.
The new vaccine will hit the market every three to four months in the next one year.
If the vaccines initially introduced in the market are effective, the Serum Institute will not produce the rest of the vaccines.
Apart from this organization, some other organizations are also involved in vaccine production.
The vaccine being offered in Russia is likely to be tested in India.
Who will get the vaccine in the beginning ?
Whenever vaccines become available in the country, priority will be given to people working in the health sector, such as doctors, nurses and other staff.
When will the vaccine reach the general public?
Speaking at an event on Thursday, Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan said, "It is not possible to reach 135 crore Indians at a time.
The vaccine that is effective will need to be taken in two doses.
For the last 10 months, people working in the health sector have been working at the risk of their lives.
After that, people over the age of 65 will be vaccinated.
Dr. Harshvardhan also clarified that it is not the case that the government has the right to set the priorities, so they are setting their own minds.
This priority has been set by a committee set up on a scientific basis.
Member of the Policy Commission V. K. Paul is the chairman of this committee.
The list of people to be vaccinated in the first phase of health sector has been prepared by the Central and State Governments by the end of October.
Corona vaccine: Oxford vaccine with serum at a critical stage
The Oxford vaccine, which has a contract with the Serum Institute, is at a critical juncture and will be tested before Christmas, researchers said.
Oxford's performance will also benefit Indian company Serum.
In India, the Serum Institute of India is producing vaccines developed by Oxford University.
Earlier, Adar Punawala had said that the vaccine would be ready in India by December.
Human trials of the covshield vaccine will be completed by December and the vaccine may be available from January, Punawala had said.
Once the UK shares the data there and makes sure the vaccine is safe, we can apply for an emergency license to the Indian regulatory body in the next two to three weeks.
It will take time for the vaccine to arrive
But Punawala had said that it would take a long time for the vaccine to reach everyone.
Poonawala also said that there will be a shortage of corona virus vaccine by 2024.
He made the statement in an interview with the Financial Times about the production of corona vaccine.
Pharmaceutical companies are not rapidly increasing production capacity, so it will take 4 to 5 years for the vaccine to reach everyone, he said.
Even if the corona vaccine is said to be given in two phases like the measles vaccination campaign, the world will initially need about 15 billion doses, he said.
Given the state of the country's vaccine supply chain, we need to think about how the vaccine can be safely delivered to the country's 140 crore people, Punawala said.
The Serum Institute, along with 5 other companies around the world, will produce 1 billion doses of corona.
Half of this dose will be reserved for India, while half the dose will be supplied to the world, the Serum Institute has clarified.
However, Poonawala said that if large quantities of the vaccine were demanded from the US and Europe, other countries would lag behind.
Meanwhile, the Serum Institute vaccine will cost Rs 225.
The Pune-based Serum Institute of India has entered into an agreement with Gavi, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to produce vaccine doses of over 100 million corona.
The ्स 150 million will be used to make the vaccine through the Gates Foundation's Strategic Fund.
Each dose of the vaccine will cost US 3 3, or Rs 225.
Corona: Are we in a 'touch famine' crisis?
Corona's companionship has plunged us into a new crisis.
In the case of people living alone, the chances are much higher.
Are we in a new health crisis?
Were some people even in this crisis before Corona?
BBC Radio 4 and the Welcome Collection jointly submitted a questionnaire to test this touch.
Do friends or strangers like to touch the body?
The test received mixed reactions on whether people get enough touch and whether society gets it.
Just over half of the respondents wrote that they had a small amount of touch in their lives, while 42 percent said that they had enough of the touch.
So it is clear that some people have an appetite for touch.
In research, about 75 percent said they like touch, while 27 percent said no.
The team also considered people's age and gender.
Two important things emerged from this observation.
The first is personality.
The second point is the relationship with other people.
Some people are more lenient with others.
Consensual touch is an important issue for people who want touch but the current world does not allow it.
Moreover, after the #MeToo movement on social media, people have become more conscious about touching others.
The next most important reason is the lack of social interaction.
This test shows how effective even a proper touch can be.
Research has also shown that people who love touch are satisfied or happy.
This research was done before the lockdown began.
People used to say that you don't feel much touch at that time.
Tiffany Field, a psychiatrist at the University of Miami School of Medicine in the United States, conducted an online survey in April.
By the end of April, people were beginning to feel that we were out of touch.
The second study was conducted by Merle Fairhurst in April.
In April, 61 per cent of people did not feel the touch of strangers, while 35 per cent did not feel the touch of their families.
If you hit the skin at a speed of 3 cm per second, it gets a specific reaction from the body.
Now you may think that people who were stuck in the house during the lockdown had spent time with their families.
But the findings of this research are different.
Only one in five parents did such things as hugging, hugging, or kissing their children.
That is why it is not surprising to say that we have lost touch.
The human body has a mechanism for recognizing the right or pleasant touch.
Chemical processes take place in the body after a pleasant touch is felt.
Not only that, but even considering such things, dopamine begins to become a hormone.
So what should we do about touch when the fear of infection is everywhere in the Corona period?
Many of the benefits of touch to people were found in research in April.
Research has shown that applying lotions or creams to your body can give you the same results as eating good food.
Touch has a unique significance.
If you can't touch anyone else, hug yourself.
Remember a beautiful hug you took in the past and try to relive that moment by wrapping your arms around your body.

Corona vaccine: how to vaccinate billions of people?
Vaccinating billions of people is going to be a big challenge.PHOTO SOURCE,REUTERS
India is a superpower when it comes to vaccine production.
A huge vaccination campaign is being carried out in India.
There are six major vaccine manufacturers in India, including the Serum Institute of India, the world's largest vaccine manufacturer.
By July next year, India plans to get 50 crore vaccines on covid and vaccinate about 250 million people.
In India, large populations are vaccinated every year and the same experience has now set such a big target.
The vaccination program in India is 42 years old.
In addition, India has a well-organized system for storing and quantifying these vaccines.
However, experts say that the first vaccination of billions of people, including billions of adults, against Covid 19 is difficult and unprecedented.
Out of 30 vaccines being developed in India, clinical trials of 5 vaccines are underway.
Apart from this, trials of Bharat Biotech vaccine, which is being developed in the country, are also underway.
AstraZeneca vaccine is also being tested in India.
Selecting some vaccines from the available vaccines, their distribution, deciding who to vaccinate at the beginning is a big challenge.
She was the first Indian woman to be elected a Fellow in the Royal Society of London.
We don't want to underestimate the complexity of the process.
What are the challenges facing India in the vaccination campaign?
Supply Chain and Logistics (Transportation)
There are about 37,000 cold chain stores in India.
These vaccines can be sent to 80 lakh places from these places.
India will need enough auto disabled syringes to deliver so many vaccines.
India's largest syringe maker has said it aims to produce 1 billion syringes by next year to meet the growing demand for such syringes.
The question then arises as to whether the supply of medical glass vials for vaccines should be maintained.
India's vaccination program is implemented with the help of about 40 lakh doctors and nurses.
I am worried about how we will take these things to rural India, Kiran Majumdar-Shaw, founder of Biocon, a leading biotechnology company in the country, told me.
Who will get the vaccine first?
The vaccine will be available in limited quantities until next year.
Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said the vaccine would be available to private and government health workers and frontline workers from 'other departments' first.
We will never have enough vaccines available.
The Serum Institute in Pune is the largest vaccine manufacturer in the world.
The Serum Institute in Pune is the largest vaccine manufacturer in the world.
So in a country where most of the healthcare system is private, will the private health worker be given priority or the government employee?
Will permanent employees be preferred over contract employees?
If senior citizens with co-morbidity are eligible for early vaccination, which of the various diseases will be given priority?
For example, more than 7 crore people in India have diabetes.
It will not be possible to deliver the vaccine to all the 30 states at the same time.
It is inevitable that the question will be asked whether there will be equality and no discrimination.
Look at the millions of doses of vaccines
Prashant Yadav says it would be easier for India to get enough doses to reach so many people relatively quickly if it contracts with different vaccine manufacturers to produce a bunch of different vaccines rather than relying on a single vaccine.
He is studying the healthcare supply chain at the Center for Global Development in Washington.
However, he says that the success of the regular vaccination campaign does not mean that the vaccination campaign for Kovid-19 will be successful.
Prashant Yadav says, "Even though the regular vaccination drive is largely carried out by government clinics, there is no plan to run such a vaccination campaign for adults and some of these adults do not visit government health centers regularly."
That is why it is important to involve both private and government agencies in the vaccination campaign for Covid 19, he said.
Kiran Mazumdar Shaw and Nandan Nilekani, co-founder of Infosys, suggested that the Aadhaar number should be used to keep track of who is being vaccinated.
Six companies in India are trying to develop a vaccine for covid.
We have to come up with a system that will give 1 crore vaccines a day across the country but it will all have a common digital foundation, Nilekani told a newspaper .
Corruption to get vaccinated?
Concerns have also been raised about corruption in obtaining the vaccine.
How will the authorities ensure that people do not submit false documents so that you can be included in the list of early vaccinators?
Note the side effects
Vaccines have side effects on some people.
However, researchers have found that the incidence of such side effects is low.
So if something like this happens, it can create fear about these vaccines.
Who will pay?
This is probably the biggest question. Will the government take control of all doses of vaccine and then ask the states to implement free or low cost vaccination campaign?
Will the rich be able to buy for themselves the doses available in the market through private distribution and sale?
Until the outbreak is stopped, the government should bear the cost of vaccination given to every Indian, said Dr. There is a ripple effect.
Nandan Nilekani estimates that a single dose of the vaccine will initially cost between 3 to 5 US dollars (225 to 375 rupees).
Therefore, a vaccine that costs half a dollar, or Rs 36-37 per dose, which is available in abundance and requires a single dose, will be suitable for India, says Gagandeep Kang.
Corona vaccine: Apply for emergency license in two weeks, initially distributed in India - Adar Punawala
In the next two weeks, Siram Institute will apply to the Government of India for an emergency license, said Adar Punawala, CEO and owner of Siram.
Also, the vaccine will be distributed initially in India, then in the Caucasus, the countries in Africa, said Adar Punawala.
The Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi visited the Serum Institute today (November 28) and took stock.
Regarding the PM's visit, Adar Punawala said, "The PM has held in-depth discussions with members of the Serum Institute.
The Prime Minister had detailed information about the vaccine.
The vaccine being developed at the Serum Institute is good.
Narendra Modi reviews vaccine production
The Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi visited the Serum Institute of India in Pune to review the production of corona vaccine.
Narendra Modi arrived at Lohgaon Airport in Pune on an Air Force plane.
He informed about the work of vaccine in Siram Institute.
Adar Poonawala, CEO and owner of Siram Institute, along with his family members were also present on the occasion.
Why the tour is planned with all the care about Corona.
He also visited vaccine companies in Ahmedabad and Hyderabad
Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit three vaccine manufacturers in the country on Saturday (November 28).
First, Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Zydus Biotech Park in Ahmedabad.
After Ahmedabad, he will visit Bharat Biotech in Hyderabad in the afternoon and then Serum Institute of India in Pune.
They will review the progress of vaccine production in all these companies, their readiness to produce large quantities of vaccines when the time comes.
Corona vaccine: The government has never said to vaccinate the whole country - Union Health Secretary
The government has never said it will vaccinate the entire country.
When we discuss issues related to science, it would be better if we come with basic information related to the subject.
Bhushan reiterated that the government has never said that everyone in the country will be vaccinated.
Corona infection can break the chain of infection if we can vaccinate people who are in a critical condition.
The role of the mask is extremely important.
Pfizer seeks permission from Government of India for emergency use of Corona vaccine
Pfizer has asked the government for permission to vaccinate.
Pfizer, a pharmaceutical company, has asked the Indian government to approve the anti-Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use in India.
Pfizer last week received calls from the governments of Britain and Bahrain for emergency use of the anti-corona vaccine.

Parents are complaining that some schools are charging unreasonable fees and depriving them of education if they do not pay the fees.
Also, parents are asking why they have to pay full fees as the school is closed.
Varsha Gaikwad said, "We had issued a ruling to reduce fees during the Corona period.
But if the school does not provide online education due to non-payment of fees or the student suffers academic loss, the parents should lodge a complaint with the education authorities.

An atmosphere of healing and fear
Covid-19 has spread all over India.
In India, the number of beds in hospitals has been increased to fight the corona epidemic, but the number of health workers is not as expected.
In such a situation, the hospitals gave practical training to each doctor.
But even that is not enough.
With the onset of cold weather, the number of patients has also started increasing. In such a situation, the energy in the doctor is running out.
Speaking about this, Dr. "Actually, Corona has never run out of hospitals, but people in the outside world have no idea," says Kakkar.

Is pork used in making corona vaccine? Reality check
The covid vaccination campaign started in India on January 16 and there have been many claims on social media about the vaccine before and since.
The government has also appealed to all to get vaccinated without paying attention to 'rumors and misinformation'.
We are going to verify the veracity of some of the claims made on a large scale.
Claim: The vaccine will make you impotent - wrong
A political leader from Uttar Pradesh has recently made this claim.
Samajwadi Party leader Ashitosh Sinha said, "I think there is something in Lashi that can harm your body.
Earlier, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav had also criticized the corona vaccine as 'BJP vaccine'.
However, there is no evidence that the vaccine can cause impotence.
The vaccine can cause a slight fever or body aches.
Union Health Minister Dr. Harshvardhan has also rejected this claim.
Vaccination makes a person impotent, a claim not new in India.
There is no truth in this claim and no such evidence is available.
Claim - Vaccines expensive in the US and England
A similar false claim is being made about India and the Anglo-American vaccine.
To show that the vaccination program in India is better than in both the US and the UK, one has to pay Rs 5,000 for the corona vaccine in the US and Rs 3,000 for the vaccine in the UK. However, a Twitter user wrote that the vaccine is free in India.
Hindi news channel ABP News also showed this news.
In fact, the US government has made it clear that the vaccine will be provided free of charge.
However, this fee is also included in the health insurance and those who do not have health insurance will be paid under the Special Covid Relief Fund.
This claim is also false about England.
The National Health Service is provided from the taxes paid by the citizens and the health care is free for the citizens.
In the first phase of vaccination in India, health workers were vaccinated and the vaccine was free for them.
Claim - Corona lasi in dukaracam meat
Corona vaccine may contain pork and therefore Muslims should not be vaccinated, some Muslim clerics in India have appealed.
Gelatin, sometimes made from pork, is used as a stabilizer in vaccines against many diseases, and eating pork is forbidden in the Muslim religion.
Corona's vaccine has not been declared "halal" under Islamic law, a post circulated on social media.
Two vaccines for corona are allowed in India .
Neither of these vaccines used gelatin made from pork.
Pfizer and Moderna are two other corona vaccines that do not contain pork.
Some of the pork-related posts circulating on social media claim to have used pork in a Chinese-made vaccine.
In some other countries, disputes have arisen over Chinese vaccines.
Claim - Lashi has a microchip
Conspiracy theories about corona vaccine are circulating in many parts of the world.
A short video of a Muslim cleric is circulating on social media.
The video also went viral on Twitter and Facebook earlier this month.
However, despite repeated claims by 'conspiracy theorists' around the world, no vaccine uses a microchip.
Corona virus: 5 important ways to keep corona away at home and in the office
Can pure fresh air keep the corona away?
The spacious design that keeps the air moving is important in keeping the corona away from staying at home.
For months, we have been told to wash our hands, apply sanitizer, and observe social distance to keep the corona virus at bay.
But according to scientists and engineers, what air we breathe is just as important as what goes into our respiratory bodies.
Let's look at how good ventilation is the key, with five points.
If you go into a room and feel that the air is stale, then there must be something wrong with the ventilation.
If clean open air does not play, the chances of getting infected with the corona virus increase.
According to new research, corona viruses are more likely to spread through the air in densely populated areas where air is trapped.
A regulation for workplaces was issued after the corona infection began to grow.
That's why if you go somewhere and find yourself in a quandary, get out of there, says Dr. Krishna Kumar, Technical Director, Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers.
He clarified that it is necessary to get pure open air continuously.
If the corona infected person is in the building and you can leave a lot of free air there, then you are working to clean the contaminated air through that infected person. You reduce the risk of other people getting corona infections.
2. Know the design of AC
In offices, shops are equipped with air conditioning system.
Split air conditioner is a white box mounted on the wall.
In other words, this AC makes the air hot and cold.
One customer had a corona infection.
If a large amount of open air had come in from the outside, they thought the corona virus would have been prevented and fewer people would have been infected.
3. The ratio of open air
Modern types of buildings have sealed glass, so how will the new open air continue to play?
You depend on the ventilation system.
Considering the corona infection, more and more new fresh air is being urged to be released into the enclosed environment.
Professor Cath Knox says it's best to have 100 percent pure fresh air.
The more open air there is in the building, the less likely it is that the corona virus will spread.
To keep 100 percent open air fresh, the air has to be heated in the cold and heated in the summer, and it requires energy.
4. Check that there is no virus in the filter
In modern ventilation systems, make sure the filters are fitted but not foolproof.
In the United States, researchers at the Oregon University of Health and Sciences found that filters blocked corona viruses, but in some cases the viruses escaped without getting caught in the filters.
According to Professor Kevin van der Weilberg, an inspection of the filter reveals whether a corona-infected person is working in the building.
A call center on the 11th floor in South Korea infected more than 90 people with a corona.
Dr. Weimlenberg thinks that if the filter data is checked, it is possible to decide where to expel the virus and how to prevent it.
5. Lack of fresh air
Talk to any expert in the field.
But the person who manages this job can tell that it is not so easy.
Nick Wirth was designing a Formula One racing car.
If the infected person is by the window, the virus can reach people downstairs through his or her exhalation.
More and more fresh air is good, but if the air is flowing horizontally and contains viruses, it can have an effect.
Professor Kath Knox was asked about this.
More people can be infected with the corona through an open window.
There are many controversies in this regard because we still do not know many things about the corona virus.
But one thing is for sure, the air we breathe must be pure, fresh.
Corona Virus: Is the current drop in numbers the silence before the second wave?
Is it dramatic or incomprehensible to reduce the number of corona patients in India as many think?
Is the corona virus withdrawing from India, the country where the corona is expected to kill millions?
In October , I wrote in detail about why the spread of corona is declining across the country .
Since then the situation has improved a lot.
Since last week, an average of 10,000 corona patients have been found in the country every day.
So far, more than 1 crore people in India have been infected with the corona.
Most epidemics usually increase in bell-shaped curves and worsen as well.
While corona infection is declining in India, there is nothing unusual about it.
Experts believe that there are several possible reasons for the decline in the number of corona patients.
Bhramar Mukherjee, a professor of biology and epidemiology at the University of Michigan, says, "We do not yet have an explanation for the epidemic.
Heard immunity is the immunity of a group.
Why is India far from herd immunity?
According to a recent CIRO survey, 21 percent of adults and 25 percent of young people are already infected with corona.
The report also found that 31 per cent of slum dwellers, 26 per cent of non-slum dwellers but 26 per cent of urban dwellers and 19 per cent of rural dwellers were infected with corona.
But experts say that number is still very low.
The president of the Delhi-based think tank 'Public Health Foundation of India', Dr. K Srinath Reddy said, "There is no region in the country that has acquired herd immunity. Anyway, some small parts may exist."
Therefore, despite the high incidence of infection, people who have not yet been infected with the corona can live in their own protected areas.
Why is the number of patients declining?
There are various reasons for this, experts say.
One is that cases of corona patients are declining at different times in different parts of the country.
People in densely populated cities are more likely to be infected with corona than small villages.
In my opinion, the risk of corona infection is much higher than what the survey is saying.
Another reason for this is that many patients in India were not diagnosed, as hundreds of infected people did not show symptoms of corona.
If we had a large number of patients with very mild or asymptomatic symptoms, we would have already reached herd immunity.
Is low mortality a secret?
Most scientists say that more Indians have died from corona infection than official figures.
However, the low figures did not create an atmosphere of public fear.
India announced a lockdown at the end of March to prevent the spread of the virus.
Extensive use of masks, the closure of schools and offices, and the introduction of the work-from-home option have reduced the incidence of corona infection in the worst-hit cities.
Coronas cause fewer deaths among young people because they have better immune systems, scientists say.
However, more than 65 per cent of Indians live and work in rural areas.
The majority of urban workers work in the unorganized sector.
People who work in open or semi-enclosed spaces have a lower risk of infection, he said. Says Reddy.
Is there another wave in India?
It would be hasty to say that.
Some experts fear that corona infection in India could increase significantly during the early monsoon season.
After the end of the monsoon, we can only assess whether the corona has started spreading in the country again, based on the available information, a communicable disease specialist said on condition of anonymity.
Scientists say a new species of corona found in South Africa, Brazil and the UK is the real problem .
Many in India are not infected with the corona.
By the end of January, 160 patients with corona UK strain had been found in India.
A new strain of the corona was discovered in September in Kent, UK, and in the next two months it caused another wave.
There are enough scientific laboratories in India, but genome sequencing is still a challenge, experts say.
The story of Corona's new strain is too long.
India needs to accelerate vaccination campaigns .
The government aims to vaccinate 300 million people by August to ensure that the second wave of corona does not spread.
But, there is no satisfactory progress yet.
Corona Information: Answers to 11 questions in your mind such as lockdown, pets, mask use.
Do you have any questions about corona virus?
BBC Marathi is trying to give direct and accurate answers to all your questions according to the information given by experts from all over the world.
1. In which zone is my district? How did it happen
The central government on May 1 released a district-wise list of corona viruses across the country.
All the districts are divided into Red, Orange and Green zones by the number of patients in each district, how many days it doubles (doubling rate), the extent and scope of testing as well as expert observation.
A red zone is a district, taluka or municipal area where a large number of corona patients may have been found.
Orange Zone is a district in which no new coronary artery disease has been detected in the last 14 days.
So the green zone is the district in which no corona patient has been found or no new patient has been found in the last 21 days.
You can read more about this here in which zone is my district?
2. Call the maid?
There is some confusion as to whether they will be able to go for housework as the maid is not included in the list given by the state government on what will continue and what will be closed in the third phase of the lockdown.
But the maid does not need permission to go for housework except in the containment (restricted) zone, the Chief Minister's Office has informed BBC Marathi.
If the maid lives in the landlord's house, permission is not required, he added.
However, if the housing society does not want to allow someone to come in, they can take an independent decision, but they need a good reason to deny the permission, Gagrani said.
3. Why did the number increase despite the lockdown?
Even after a month and a half of lockdown, the number of corona patients is increasing in the country including Maharashtra.
There could be a number of reasons for the increase in the number of patients - such as whether the lockdown is being strictly enforced.
State Survey Officer Dr. about the statistics in Maharashtra.
Also, in cities like Mumbai and Pune, people live in densely populated areas.
With the increasing number of corona tests, the number of patients will naturally increase.
Another reason for this is that about 80 percent of patients with corona are asymptomatic, meaning they do not show any symptoms.
4. Will Corona go when summer arrives?
Many had said so. You may have also received such WhatsApp messages.
No virus is destroyed at 60-70C.
The British doctor Sarah Jarvis says the temperature is affected by the corona virus.
The virologist Dr. According to Paresh Deshpande, rising temperatures can greatly reduce the duration of its extinction.
It is generally known that the virus does not last long outside the body during summer days, but the exact effect of heat on it is not yet known.
Mark Lipsich, a researcher at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, says, "We can't just sit back and hope that the harsh summer will come and stop the spread of the corona virus.
5. Are coronaviruses at higher risk for pregnant women?
During pregnancy, a lot of changes take place in the body.
Paul Hunter, a professor at the University of Anglia in the UK, says, "It's not fair to say that everything is fine with just 9 pregnant women.
Although the corona virus is now new, pregnant women are at higher risk of contracting the flu than other women their age.
The youngest patient ever infected with the corona virus was a one-day-old baby.
6. Do pets cause corona?
The disease is said to have spread to humans by eating the flesh of a wild animal in Wuhan.
But in the first week of April, a 4-year-old tiger in a zoo in the United States was also infected with the corona virus, according to a report.
According to the evidence available so far , cats and dogs have been infected with corona virus in some places.
But the condition of any of the animals was not alarming.
Researchers and veterinarians think this is very unlikely.
But can corona virus be transmitted from animal fur?
7. Will wearing a mask keep me safe?
Much depends on which mask you are using.
But wearing a mask does one more thing - constantly rubbing your face.
But not everyone has to wear a mask.
Who are sick and who have symptoms of corona
Who are serving or caring for coronaries.
Medical masks should be reserved for health workers only, the WHO said.
Other ordinary people have to wear masks, not because -
When wearing or removing masks, they can be contaminated by coughing or sneezing by other people
It is more effective to wash your hands regularly and observe social distance
Masks can create a false feeling that you are safe
8. Does eating garlic make the corona go away?
Garlic is a health nutrient. It has some anti-microbial properties.
But there is no evidence that eating garlic protects against the corona virus.
Also, there is no evidence that eating cloves, swallowing salt water, or placing a mole under the nose can prevent corona.
If you read or hear anywhere that any home remedy cures corona virus, please don't believe it.
Yes, we all know that including fruits and vegetables in our diet and drinking plenty of water is beneficial for overall health.
9. Will insurance companies pay for the treatment?
If your doctor suspects you are infected with the corona virus, they will refer you directly to a government hospital.
Although there is currently no panacea for corona, the mortality rate is 1 to 3 percent, meaning that 97-98 out of 100 people recover and return home.
Mayank Bathwal, CEO, Aditya Birla Health Insurance, said, "Currently, all our insurance products and health indemnity reimbursement products cover the corona virus.
But if you don't hire, your expenses won't be covered.
IRDAI is the regulatory body of insurance companies.
10. Infection due to touching notes?
You also know how much money you have and how you handle it.
The Chinese government is currently ordering its banks to sterilize all notes.
11. How to take care?
For now, just wash your hands, use a mask, and hold a handkerchief over your nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing.
If you have a cold-cough-fever, be careful, see a doctor immediately and take the necessary medicine.
Corona Vaccine: Vaccination of 60-year-olds and 45-year-olds from March 1 - Javadekar
The general public's wait for the vaccine is about to end.
Citizens will be able to get the vaccine at 10,000 government and 20,000 private vaccination centers across the country.
The vaccination drive was launched on January 16 last month after vaccines were allowed in India.
Covid warriors are the medical personnel working in the front line for the eradication of corona, the police as well as the government employees of the concerned departments.
Accordingly, doctors, nurses and other medical personnel from all parts of the country were initially vaccinated.
So, the number of vaccinated people in the country has gone up to more than 1 crore.
Guidelines issued by the Center
The central government on December 14 issued a regulation on how corona vaccine will be given to everyone in India.
According to PTI, "100 to 200 people will be vaccinated in each session every day.
Also only one person at a time will be allowed to go to the vaccination center.
CLICK HERE to select your favorite Indian female player
These instructions to the states state the use of technology.
The digital platform will be used to track vaccine recipients as well as the corona virus vaccine.
Only those who are registered at the vaccination centers will be vaccinated.
The Center has instructed the states to plan according to which company's vaccines will be available in which states.
According to the Covid Vaccine Operational Guidelines, the vaccinated box, bottle or ice-pack should not be exposed to direct sunlight.
The vaccine will be taken out of the storage area only after the person arrives to inject it.
According to the rules, "100 people will be vaccinated in each session.
According to the rules, the central government plans to vaccinate 30 crore people in the first phase of the vaccination drive.
Citizens need to register on the Co-Win website to get vaccinated.
Which vaccine will be used in India?
It is hoped that 60 crore people will be vaccinated in India in the first phase by August 2021, said V.S. K. Was expressed by Paul.
Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech, which conduct vaccine trials in India, have applied to the regulator for permission for emergency use.
Serum's Covishield, Bharat Biotech's Covaxin, Zydus Cadilla's Zykov B and Russia's Sputnik 5 will be available in India as the temperature is ideal for storing these four vaccines.
Cold storage systems are being set up on a large scale in India to store the vaccine, which can be stored at a temperature of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius. K. Paul had said.
Extremely cold temperatures are required to store Pfizer and Modern vaccines.
Pfizer had applied for permission for emergency use in India, but withdrew the application in early February.
Here are five things we need to learn from these countries that have overcome the Corona outbreak
Various measures have been taken by different countries over the past year to curb the spread of the corona virus.
I aired Covid for the last year.
After studying all this information, I realized that there are four things that are important to control the spread of the virus and the deaths caused by the virus.
Take prompt and effective action to control and check passengers at the border
Testing, tracking and tracing every suspected patient suspected of having coronary infection.
To provide all that help to those who have been quarantined to prevent the spread of the virus
Effective leadership and consistent and timely public messaging
No one has claimed that we all took the right measures.
Step 1: Preparation
Stanley Park lives in Seoul, the capital of South Korea.
A hospital like Yangji in Seoul, South Korea, was completely reserved for Kovid.
This is not his first experience with global communicable diseases, says Stanley.
Not only Stanley but his country also learned a lesson from that merger and made 48 amendments to deal with emergencies that posed a threat to public health.
Xu Yeon had just returned from Atlanta.
South Korean Prime Minister Chung Sai-kyun had said, "History repeats itself - we have taken strict preventive measures from the beginning to prevent this from happening again."
Step 2: Test, track and trace
It was March last year.
The lockdown was imposed in the UK at the end of March last year.
On the other hand, most of the East Asian countries started tracing in January.
Outside the hospital, a 'track and test' team is monitoring every suspect.
Not only that, but in South Korea, when there were no cases of Kovid-19 disease, Prime Minister Chung Sai-kyun took up the matter himself and took action, prioritizing 'tests, tracks and traces'.
It simply came to our notice then that we were getting better and better results, he said.
South Korea has a population of 52 million and 1,693 people have died from corona so far.
On the other hand, the UK government says that the testing system is constantly improving and is doing everything possible to make it stronger.
Step 3: Quarantine assistance
Usha Kumari, a community health worker in Kerala, India, says:
There are 30,000 'Asha employees' like Usha in Kerala.
In the area allotted to Usha, those who were instructed to stay in isolation in the house were given the responsibility of making sure that they were following all the given rules and providing them with all the things they needed.
Not only that, but in Kerala, 'Community Kitchen' was started from the very beginning of Kovid.
Financial assistance was also given to the needy.
The report was released in September by the UK-based Scientific Advice Group for Emergencies.
Following this experience, the UK government has broadened the criteria for providing financial assistance to coronet sufferers in isolation.
Kerala was hit by the Nipah virus three years ago.
Kerala has a population of 3.5 crore.
Step 4: Take care of the elderly
In early April last year, General Physician Lisa Federley began testing coronaviruses in care homes in Tbingen, Germany.
In Italy and Spain, Covid-19 had the greatest impact on senior citizens, and Boris Palmer, the mayor of Tbingen, felt that "a shield should be built around those most at risk."
He gave the local funds received by the mayor to help the senior citizens.
As a result of all this, the University Hospital in the city was not crowded with Covid patients and it was not time to close any other operations at the hospital.
Compared to other countries in the UK, Germany adopted a slightly different approach to preventing the spread of the corona.
In fact, care homes across the UK have been closed to outsiders from the very beginning.
Infectious Diseases Pvt. "Nursing homes are the most high-risk people in the elderly, and this is not surprising," said Dale Fischer.
Step 5: Vaccination campaign
Today more than two and a half million citizens in the UK have received at least one dose of the corona vaccine.
The key to the UK's success in the vaccination campaign is planning for the campaign.
However, this planning has not been seen in Europe.
The situation is even worse in developing nations.
Michael Kuta lives in Cape Town, South Africa.
Gavi, an organization of G-7 countries, was formed to help poor countries get the corona vaccine.
In any case, a concerted effort at the international level is needed when formulating a vaccination policy.
'Big price paid'
Vaccine distribution has started globally today.
Pvt. Dale Fisher says we should learn from the experience of the last 12 months.
He says, "A great crisis has befallen us and we have paid a heavy price for it.
Why is lockdown being discussed in Maharashtra?
The second wave of corona virus outbreak has hit Maharashtra and lockdown is being discussed again to curb the spread of the disease.
The number of patients has been declining, but since the end of February, it has been growing rapidly again.
But how serious is the situation in the state really?
Record increase in patient numbers
This graph will show how much faster the number of patients has increased during the second wave than the first wave of covid.
The active patient population is the number of patients currently suffering from covid.
The country was locked down at the beginning of Kovid's outbreak.
In September, six months after the outbreak, the eruption of Kovid reached its peak in Maharashtra.
But it began to rise again in mid-February, and within a month, in March, the number of patients had exploded.
Maharashtra ranks third in the world
Maharashtra ranks third in the world in terms of total number of covid patients by region.
Why the situation in Maharashtra is alarming, and why it should be monitored, will be understood by looking at this table.
Maharashtra currently has the highest number of patients in the country
Considering the active number of covid patients in the country, more than sixty per cent patients are in Maharashtra.
The question is whether mutation is not responsible for the mutation in the virus due to the high number of patients in Maharashtra.
At present, however, the majority seems to agree on one thing.
Gram Panchayat elections were held in rural areas.
Increase in the number of patients in all parts of the state
During the second wave of covid, the number of patients is increasing rapidly in all parts of the state, cities and even rural areas.
See statistics of these six major cities in the state.
Increase in the number of patients in all parts of the state
But this picture was worrisome, but it was expected.
Mortality rate has come down in Maharashtra
In countries around the world where the second wave of covid has hit, the picture is more or less the same, said a public health expert.
During the second wave, the corona virus spreads faster.
In Maharashtra too, a similar picture is emerging during the second wave.
Mortality rate has come down in Maharashtra
But as the number of patients grows, there may be a shortage of medical facilities.
Could such a situation arise in the next few days?
The number of checks increased in the state
As the number of covid patients has increased in the state, so has the number of check-ups.
The number of checks increased in the state
On September 27 last year, 1 lakh 88 thousand people in the state underwent covid test.
As on March 31, 1 lakh 67 thousand 078 people in the state have undergone covid examination.
But the test positivity rate has also increased, indicating how many of them were actually infected with the corona virus.
Across the country, the current test positivity rate is around five per cent, while in Maharashtra it is 14 to 15 per cent.
The higher the test positivity rate, the higher the risk.
Contact tracing is just as important as investigation to gain control over the disease.
Vaccination rates increased
The reassuring thing is that vaccination has also started in Maharashtra.
Vaccination rates increased
However, some feel that the rate of vaccination is still low compared to other states in the country and the rate at which the number of patients is increasing in Maharashtra.
Maharashtra Vaccination
The vaccine will also be available to citizens over the age of 45 from April 1, and the speed and rate of vaccination is expected to increase.
(Statistics: Union Ministry of Health, Maharashtra State Department of Health, ICMR, Johns Hopkins University)
Corona vaccine: Vaccine registration stopped for health workers; Center instructions
The Center has directed the state government and Union Territories to ensure that health and allied workers do not register for the vaccine.
In a letter to the state government and Union Territories, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said, "The registration process for vaccines has been started for persons above 45 years of age.
The nationwide vaccination campaign started from 16th January.
Health workers and emergency services staff work to heal corona patients.
Bhushan Kumar writes, "In coordination with the State and Union Territories, all possible measures have been taken to ensure that these congregations are vaccinated.
A month has passed since these scheduled dates.
Corona, vaccine, health workers
The decision has been taken based on the feedback received from the vaccination centers.
The database of vaccinated health workers has increased by 25 per cent in the last few days.
Bhushan Kumar has directed that vigilance should be taken for the implementation of this decision at all levels.
Corona vaccine: Rajesh Tope says, 'Only enough stocks in the state for 3 days'
The second wave of Covid-19 caused a blast of corona infection in Maharashtra.
Health Minister Rajesh Tope has admitted that there is a shortage of anti-covid vaccines in the state.
Vaccination has been stopped in some districts of the state due to non-availability of vaccine.
Corona infection is spreading rapidly across the state.
On the one hand, Maharashtra is battling corona infection.
Shortage of Covid-19 vaccine in Maharashtra
According to experts, vaccination is the most effective way to control the rapidly spreading corona infection in the state.
Talking about the shortage of vaccines, Health Minister Rajesh Tope said, "Currently, there are only 1.4 million doses of anti-corona vaccines left in the state.
Vaccination has been stopped at some centers in the state.
Regarding the shortage of anti-Covid-19 vaccines in the state, Health Minister Rajesh Tope asked Union Health Minister Dr. Informed Harshvardhan.
Vaccinate people between the ages of 20 and 40
In Maharashtra, two mutations have been found in the Covid-19 virus.
Experts say the mutated virus is spreading faster.
Lockdown
Union Health Minister Dr. After the meeting with Harshvardhan, Rajesh Tope said, Currently, people in the age group of 20 to 40 are more likely to be infected with corona in the state. These people are traveling for work.
State Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had demanded vaccination of people above 25 years of age in a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi two days ago.
What does the central government say about vaccination?
According to the Union Ministry of Health, Maharashtra is at the forefront of anti-corona vaccination in the country.
8 crore people have been vaccinated so far across the country.
Speaking to reporters, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said, "The main objective of vaccination is to prevent death due to infection.
No country has decided to vaccinate people above the age of 18 without thinking, Rajesh Bhushan added.
According to the central government, the situation in Maharashtra, Punjab and Chhattisgarh is critical.
Availability of vaccine in various cities of Maharashtra
Mumbai
More than 10,000 coronary heart disease cases were reported in the city on Tuesday.
About 50,000 people are vaccinated against covid every day in Mumbai.
Currently, only two days' supply of vaccines is available with the NMC, said Suresh Kakani, Additional Commissioner, Mumbai Municipal Corporation.
Pune
In Pune, on April 6, there were 15,300 doses of covshield and only 120 doses of covacin remaining, health officials said.
Speaking to BBC, Pune District Health Officer Dr. Bhagwan Pawar said, "Late on Tuesday night, 25,000 doses of covshield and 10,000 doses of covacin were received.
If stocks of vaccine become available, vaccines can be given tomorrow, he said.
Pune ranks first in the country in Corona hotspots.
Vidarbha
Vaccination has been stopped in Gondia district due to non-availability of anti-covid vaccine.
There is no vaccine available in the district, Kapase told the BBC.
The situation is similar in other districts of Vidarbha.
District Health Officer of Amravati Dr. Speaking to the BBC, Deepak Karanjekar said, "The district has enough stocks of anti-covid vaccines for the next three days.
The head of the state's vaccination campaign, Dr. D. N. Speaking to the Times of India, Patil said, "The central government needs to ensure a steady supply of vaccines.
Kolhapur-Sangli
According to the Kolhapur and Sangli district administrations, stocks of vaccines are available in the district only today (Wednesday).
Nashik
For North Maharashtra, 32,280 doses of covacin were received, according to the health department.
Ahmednagar district health officer Dr Sangle said, "There is a shortage of vaccines in the district.
So, there are enough doses of vaccine available in Thane for the next 3-4 days, said Sandeep Malvi, Public Relations Officer, Municipal Corporation.
Why the shortage of vaccines?
The country's largest vaccination campaign was launched in the country in January.
The ministers of the Mahavikas Aghadi government in the state had alleged that Maharashtra was not getting adequate stocks of vaccines from the central government.
Speaking about the shortage of vaccines in the state, former president of the Indian Medical Association, Dr. Ravi Wankhedkar says, "It is up to the central government to decide how many vaccines to give to which state.
Vaccination campaigns should be decentralized.
Does Remedivir really save the lives of Corona patients?
Is there a shortage of remedivir?
Long queues outside drug stores and rush to get a dose of the drug, a picture that has been seen outside some drug stores for the past week.
Currently the second wave of corona infections and hence the number of patients is increasing so much that the demand for remedesivir has also increased.
Finally, the central government decided to ban the export of remedesivir.
But in October 2020, when the World Health Organization (WHO) ruled that remedivir does not save the lives of corona patients, why are we using it so much?
What is Remedesivir though?
When covid 19 disease was new, many drugs such as remedesivir, hydroxychloroquine, dexamethasone were considered globally while developing treatment methods.
Some drugs have been shown to be helpful in different ways, while others have been shown to be unhelpful.
Remedesivir is an antiviral drug
It was developed to fight Ebola
At the time of the initial outbreak of the corona, it was found to be effective in reducing symptoms.
However, it costs between Rs 1,100 and Rs 1,400 per dose
Later, the World Health Organization and a number of health organizations began to study the drugs used for corona in different countries and began research on which drugs are effective and efficient.
In October 2020, the World Health Organization released a detailed report on remedivir.
The health organization studied 11,266 patients in over 500 hospitals in 30 countries around the world, and found that remedicivir was not very effective in preventing coronary heart disease.
So why is remedivir used?
The Ministry of Health has laid down some guidelines on when to use this drug in India.
Accordingly, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and Health Minister Rajesh Tope have also repeatedly expressed the view that remedicivir should be avoided.
Speaking at a press conference in Jalna, Rajesh Tope said, “Effective and efficient use of Remedesivir is a priority of the state government for the next 15 days.
Now, you may be wondering why Remadesevir is being used.
There is no drug on corona yet.
According to the guidelines stated by the World Health Organization, overuse of remedicivir should be avoided.
When to use Remedacivir?
So when exactly to use Remedesivir?
Corona infection occurs in the lungs. The HRCT test is used to check the severity of the infection.
If the patient's fever is not under control, the drug is given as an antiviral from the 4th to the 7th day, Gaikwad clarified.
Remadecivir is currently being used so much in Maharashtra that the drug is being bought on the black market at double the price.
From now on, the stock of this medicine will be distributed from the Collectorate to the government hospitals as and when required.
Sputnik-5: Do you know about the Russian vaccine coming to India?
India has paved the way for a third vaccine.
The vaccine was developed by Russia's Gamalaya Center.
Currently, Covishield of Serum Institute and Covacin vaccine of Bharat Biotech are being used in India.
Sputnik-5 vaccine Dr. Russia has said it will give Reddy to the lab.
The Russian Direct Investment Fund will cooperate for the clinical trial and distribution of the vaccine.
Russian Direct Investment Fund and Dr. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has been signed between Reddy Labs and 30 crore doses of vaccine will be manufactured in India.

5. Damage to agriculture due to untimely rains
Vidarbha, Marathwada in Maharashtra and some parts of Western Maharashtra have received unseasonal rains.
Solapur district has received unseasonal rains for the last three days.
For the last three days, unseasonal rains have lashed the rural areas including the city of Solapur.
The current situation of any city in Maharashtra, in fact, any city in the country.
The number of people who die from covid comes to the fore every day, a little shaky, we leave by mistake, we start working.
Suddenly numbers become not just numbers but our rush for survival.
My grandmother used to say that she would patch him wherever the sky broke.
Do you know how a man who dies with a corona dies?
People who go through corona or close relatives often suffer from the same disease.
I saw it in the cemetery.
How to tell in detail.
The hearse is coming, the cheetahs are burning.
Husband, wife, world, children are nobody.
The dead man is wrapped in plastic, there is no question of bringing him home.
When the man went to the hospital, he was in a hurry to get out of bed.
At least the closest people who could bury their men were called lucky (!).
A story told by a journalist friend.
Do you know what happens when your man dies?
A few days ago I saw a photo from Brazil.
It does not leave a mark after death.
When someone cries, no one comes forward to put his hand on his shoulder to comfort him.
In the flames of the six or seven cheetahs burning in front of him, he does not even know where his man was set on fire.
Now the people who have stopped to think about when their man will be numbered to burn in the leopard, the men working in the cemetery almost like a machine, the ambulances that are constantly coming, the cheetahs in front of them and their light everywhere is just horrible.
From a distance of half a kilometer, you can see that there is a cemetery in front of you.
The rest of the year is not Panavati, time is not Panavati, we are human beings Panavati.
Note: A member of BBC Marathi has shared his experience in this blog.
Corona virus: What tests should be done to check for covid 19?
Testing is the only option to find out if a person has a corona infection.
From the very beginning, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said that testing is a great weapon in the war against corona.
Three types of tests can be done to see if the corona virus has entered your body.
But it is equally important to understand the exact differences between these tests and their accuracy.
What is an RT-PCR test?
RT-PCR stands for Real Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction.
This is also called swab test.
This laboratory test can take 2 to 5 hours, but considering the overall load on the labs, the results are usually given in one day in private laboratories in Maharashtra, while it takes 2 days in the laboratories of government hospitals.
The RT-PCR test can tell for sure if the corona is infected.
ICMR calls this test the gold standard of testing.
What is a Rapid Antigen Test?
Antigens are present on the surface of viruses that enter the body .
These tests also take swab samples similar to RT-PCR.
Samples of this test do not need to be taken to a laboratory for testing.
But these tests are likely to result in a false negative.
The ICMR states that a separate RT-PCR test is not required for positive results.
What is a Rapid Antibody Test?
Our body's immune system builds protein cells through plasma to fight a virus.
A person's blood samples are taken in an antibody test.
CIRO surveys have been conducted in different cities.
The ICMR had clarified in April 2020 that these tests should be used in hotspots or for such surveys.
The role of these antibodies in the fight against corona is important, so patients who have recovered from corona are now being given plasma corona to patients who are being treated with plasma therapy.
Pune Corona: Why is Corona growing in rural Pune?
The first corona patient in the state was found in Pune, after which the graph of patient growth in Pune is on the rise.
After the unlock, the corona has now spread to rural areas as well.
This was the first case of more than 200 coronavirus patients in rural areas in a single day.
On the day the survey was conducted, on September 9, 1152 coronaviruses were found in rural Pune, while on September 10, 1297 patients were found.
The number of patients growing daily in rural Pune is significant.
If you look at the table below, you can see the number of corona victims in Pune district in the last few days.
Corona is no longer afraid
The main reason for exploring the causes of corona growing in rural areas is that there is no fear of corona among the citizens and that is why some citizens have expressed their frustration over the measures to be taken to prevent corona.
Former Sarpanch of Khanapur village near Pune, Sharad Javalkar says, "Citizens are no longer afraid of corona like before.
There are cases of not being tested even when the symptoms of corona are seen and not informing the administration about it.
For the same reason, Dr. Baramati. Himgauri Wadgaonkar draws attention, "After unlocking, many people are leaving their homes for unnecessary reasons.
After the corona, we are not tested when the symptoms appear for fear of being ostracized by society, and the disease is removed from the limbs.
Constant contact with Pune
A large number of people from rural areas near Pune come to Pune every day for work.
Khadakwasalya Sarpanch Saurabh Mate says, The number of people going to Pune for work is higher in our village.
The picture of corona in rural areas became clear from the health survey
After the city of Pune, as the number of corona patients gradually increased in the rural areas, the festivals like Ganeshotsav and Moharram came and went, so the people of Manchar decided to conduct a health survey of the village.
A group of about 30 youths and doctors from the village went from house to house and conducted a preliminary examination of the citizens.
Only those with symptoms were sent for corona testing.
Former Sarpanch of Manchar village Datta Ganjale said, "Ganpati and Moharram are celebrated in our village with great enthusiasm.
Emphasis on micro-surveys
Corona patients are found in large numbers in 98 gram panchayats around Pune city.
Prasad said, "Currently, we are conducting health surveys in 98 villages with high number of patients.
Prasad further says, "The survey is being conducted in the same manner as the census survey.
According to the Pune Zilla Parishad, a total of 36,140 people have been infected with corona till September 22, while 23,135 people have recovered from corona.
On this day, 9336 patients are undergoing treatment in the hospital while 2777 patients are in home isolation.
What exactly is the disease that affects children after the corona virus is cured?
Infants with coronary artery disease are more likely to have a rare infection.
What is the infection after Covid-19 ?
Over the last few days, cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MISC) or Pediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (PIMS) have been on the rise in the state. Not only in Mumbai, Thane and Vashi but also in areas like Vaijapur, children infected with Covid-19 were found to be infected.
Talking about this infection in children, the Chief Executive Officer of Wadia Children's Hospital in Mumbai, Dr. Mini Bodhanwala said,
The infection has been found in children who have undergone corona in the last few days.
The main cause of the disease is a sudden change in the immune system of the children.
What exactly is Kovisaki disease?
According to doctors, although the disease is rare, it can be fatal for young children.
A pediatrician from Vaijapur taluka of Aurangabad, Dr. This post-covidar disease affects the blood vessels and heart in young children.
In this disease, the body's immune system starts fighting against its own body, which affects the organs.
Pediatric Rheumatologist at Jupiter Hospital, Thane, Dr. Vijay Vishwanathan has also been treating children suffering from the disease in the last few days.
Dr. Viswanathan says, "Children's immune system is different from that of adults.
The disease is most commonly found in children between the ages of 7 and 15.
What are the symptoms of Kovisaki disease ?
Dr. According to Amol, "Fever and scarring are the main symptoms of the disease.
Dr. A few days back, Amol had diagnosed a seven-and-a-half-year-old boy in Vaijapur with Pediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (PIMS).
To explain the symptoms of this disease to the people in simple words, Dr. Vijay Vishwanathan has created an English alphabet chart for the people.
A- Abdominal pain
B- Bloody Eyes
C-Cardiac effects
D-Diarrhoea
E- Extreme Tiredness
Fever
Dr. Viswanathan says, "If parents take note of the A_B_C_D and pay attention to the changes in the body of the child, timely diagnosis and treatment is possible.
Is this disease different from 'Kawasaki' infection?
According to Web-MD, Kawasaki is a disease caused by viruses, bacteria or other causes.
Symptoms of Kawasaki-

'Build a special covid center for children'
Mumbai is now slowly recovering.
Dr. Subhash Salunkhe is an advisor to the state government. Dr. Salunkhe has instructed the state government to set up a special Covid-19 center for children.
Speaking to the BBC, Dr. Subhash Salunkhe says, "Children have a good immune system.
There is no denying the possibility of an increase in cases in children in the coming days.
Also, there are some diseases in children who have been released from Covid-19.
If you have symptoms of abdominal pain and diarrhea during Corona ...
I had diarrhea (diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration) so I initially took the usual diarrhea pills.
This is the experience of Bashir Jamadar, a recently released journalist.
Some patients do not show the symptoms that are common to coronavirus patients.
'Don't ignore diarrhea'
Patients are also confused as these are not the main symptoms of corona virus, such as fever, chills, sore throat, cough, and odorlessness.
One of our drivers was also admitted to Nair Hospital for treatment of diarrhea.
Even in OPDs run in government hospitals, patients with diarrhea have been found to be infected with corona.
Dr. Nair Hospital of Mumbai Municipal Corporation.
In many cases the patient appears to be ignoring these primary symptoms.
Some patients have a sore throat at the beginning.
'If the pain doesn't stop, test the corona.'
The head of the Corona Task Force, Dr. Sanjay Oak had earlier advised in a BBC interview not to take the pain off.
Although abdominal pain and diarrhea are not the main symptoms of corona, caution should be exercised.
Maharashtra does not have a large number of patients suffering from corona infection due to abdominal pain and diarrhea.
The Covid survey officer of the state health department, Dr. Speaking to BBC Marathi, Pradip Awate said, "In exceptional circumstances, diarrhea and abdominal pain are the symptoms of corona.
Corona testing is now easily possible in Mumbai and Pune as there is no need for a doctor's prescription to test for corona.
How does the corona virus spread to other organs?
The main symptoms of corona virus are that it spreads quickly to the upper part of the body, the respiratory tract.
The phlegm formed in the chest can travel to the intestines.
The corona virus appears primarily to attack the respiratory system.
Although swine flu is not a major symptom of diarrhea, there are some cases of abdominal pain and diarrhea.
What to do in case of diarrhea?
Diarrhea is more likely to occur during the rainy season due to food poisoning.
Did you have any body aches, fever or sore throat before diarrhea?
Did you come in contact with Corona Patient?
Doctors advise seniors, people with diabetes and other serious illnesses to have a corona test even if they have diarrhea.
Corona virus: What does India's improved graph mean?
It has been more than six months since the outbreak of the corona virus.
The university’s website opened on Wednesday (September 23).
I was surprised to see this graph when the number of patients was increasing by 70-80 thousand every day.
But the answer is not as simple as it seems.
Johns Hopkins figures show an average of the last seven days.
Raman Gangakhedkar, who is associated with the CG Pandit National Chair in Pune, says, "Coming down the graph just means dropping new patients.
Even with fewer tests, patients may be less likely to be found.
As many as 66.2 million tests have been conducted in India till September 22.
Dr. According to Gangakhedkar, "How it was tested is more important than how many people were tested.
Conclusions should not be drawn on the basis of tests
According to the expert information, the RT-PCR test of the concerned patient should be done after the rapid test comes negative.
Dr. Gangakhedkar explained this story with an example.
Suppose a state is undergoing 10 percent RT-PCR tests and 90 percent rapid tests.
Then this number is halved.
The RT-PCR test is considered the most accurate for corona testing.
The number of corona tests in the last two weeks has not dropped much.
The Government of India is saying that Corona's recovery rate is our success.
On Tuesday, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan dismissed all the allegations.
The central government is conducting daily, weekly and fortnightly analysis of the tests.
7 states that spoil India's graph
The seven most affected states in India are Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and West Bengal.
In the last few days, tests have been reduced in states other than Delhi.
Corona is currently widespread in rural India.
Dr. of Public Health Foundation of India.
It doesn't make much sense to see a drop in the corona's graph one day.
Currently, the government is more concerned about the situation in rural areas.
Member of Policy Commission (Health) V. K. "The government plans to send medical students to a three-month internship at a district hospital with more than 100 beds.
You can find out how the corona is spreading in rural areas from the CIRO survey.
In the second CIRO survey conducted at the national level, the survey was conducted in urban as well as rural areas.
The number of patients who have recovered in the last four days is higher than the number of new patients.
On the other hand, the time to come is festive.
Corona virus: Is the sanitizer you use the right one?
According to the Consumer Guidance Society of India, sanitizers used in Mumbai and across the state are of inferior quality.
Sanitizers have become an integral part of our lives.
Some companies are beginning to take advantage of this.
There are many sanitizers available in the market under the name of 99.9% virulent, fragrant, alcohol based.
All you need to do to protect yourself from the corona virus is use an alcohol-based sanitizer.
But, is the sanitizer you use right? Sanitizers have no side effects, do they?
A study by the Consumer Guidance Society of India, which works for consumer protection, found that more than 50 per cent of the samples taken for testing were adulterated.
What does the Consumer Guidance Society of India's study say?
122 samples of sanitizers were taken for testing
Tampering was found in 45 samples
In 5 samples people were found to have harmful methanol
The 59 samples were as shown on the label
Speaking to BBC about this, Honorary Secretary of Consumer Guidance Society of India Dr. M. S. "Gas chromatography tests were carried out on 120 samples collected from the market.
The most dangerous is the presence of methyl alcohol in 5 sanitizers.
What is Methyl Alcohol?
Methyl alcohol is a toxic substance, according to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC).
People who come in contact with methyl alcohol are more likely to be injured.
Methyl alcohol is absorbed into the skin.
Cosmetic dermatologist and surgeon from The Aesthetic Clinics, Dr. Rinki Kapoor said, “Given the growing demand for sanitizers, it has been observed that many shopkeepers are selling bogus sanitizers to make money.
The use of these bogus sanitizers increases the risk of skin problems.
The role of government in sanitizers
Speaking to BBC, state health minister Rajesh Tope said, "Non-quality sanitizer is not suitable.
Speaking about this, Dr. Kamath said, "The Center has taken note of this after our report.
Dr. Kapoor further said, "As per the order of the World Health Organization and the Central Government, sanitizers should not contain any fragrance.
Which sanitizer to buy
Talking to BBC about this, Mumbai-based dermatologist Dr. Bindu Sthalekar said, "People should be very careful while taking sanitizers.
How do you know if a sanitizer is good or bad at home?
You can also check if the sanitizer is suitable for use at home.
Dr. of Consumer Guidance Society of India.
What to take care of
Not suitable against non-alcoholic product Covid-19
Keep sanitizers away from small children
This is because injections can also cause poisoning
Sanitizer is over the counter and requires company name and expiry date
People should read the instructions on the sanitizer carefully

Corona Maharashtra: What is the condition of Jumbo Covid Hospital in Pune?
Jumbo Covid Center Pune
The city and district of Pune became a hotspot for corona infection in the country.
So far, that is, as of this writing, a total of 1 lakh 56 thousand 783 cases have been registered in Pune city, while for the district this number has reached 2 lakh 95 thousand 689.
On the one hand, Pune is the city with the highest number of tests per one lakh population in the country, while on the other hand, it is struggling to build a health system. Pune has a battle against Corona, which is going on day by day.
The first case of covid in the state was reported on March 9 in Pune.
The hospital is located on the grounds of College of Engineering Pune (COEP) in Shivajinagar area of ​​Pune.
Jumbo Covid Center Pune
But the system collapsed, the doctors started to leave, there was a big uproar when bouncers started sitting at the door of the hospital.
Journalist Pandurang Raikar died at the center on September 3 and many questions were raised.
'My brother died due to negligence of the system,' said Pandurang Raikar's sister
We were told by the agency that we are fully prepared.
Our inquiry committee is now giving notice and taking action against them.
We were allowed to go to the command center of this jumbo covid hospital.
The administration claims that everything is fine now and no one is complaining.
But this jumbo hospital in Pune, which started six months after the infection, is still not at full capacity.
The state government has given a week-long deadline to operate 800 beds.
We built 400 beds here.
Last week we brought people by special flight, buses from Kerala, Hyderabad.
Jumbo Covid Center Pune
A good activity can be seen in the facade of this center.
After being admitted to this covid center, the patients lost contact with the outside world.
If someone dies, the situation gets worse.
Dr. Shreyansh Kapale is the head of this Jumbo Covid Hospital.
Even now, I see that about 30 to 40 per cent of the patients come here after their saturation has dropped drastically.
But the question is why the pace at which the numbers were increasing in Pune could not be predicted and why the planning was not done in advance?
It was claimed that the situation was under control and Dimti was told that beds in private hospitals were also available.
According to Shekhar, in the second week of September, he was wandering around the city looking for beds for his aunt and uncle.
We started looking for beds around 11 in the morning and kept searching till night.
Still the situation is no different.
At the time of writing, there are now 4,746 beds available in the city of Pune, according to the Covid Care Center's government dashboard website, but only ICU beds with 31 ventilators.
Despite the municipality claiming to have completed a total of 800 beds, this jumbo hospital in Shivajinagar is stuck at more than half capacity.
Sassoon Hospital
The government is unduly dependent on private hospitals.
Siddharth Shirole is the MLA of Shivajinagar, Pune.
I'm not saying that if you had built it in May, the situation would have been different.
Siddharth Shirole
First of all, it took two and a half months to decide whether we wanted jumbo coveted centers.
Today, Dinanath Mangeshkar Hospital is the best running hospital.
Admittedly, you rushed to build the infrastructure early.
It's been a month since it became a center today.
State Health Minister Rajesh Tope has been visiting the city since the situation in Pune became critical.
Government hospitals like Sassoon have not been used to their full potential, the employed agency has not functioned properly and the main reason is the declining number of doctors needed.
The minus point of Pune is that government beds are scarce, but there are a lot of private beds.
So I personally held a meeting of private hospitals.
Consider one minus point of Pune, the biggest.
On the other hand, Pune's Corona graph is rising faster than any other city and district in the country.
But after June, Samyam was released and by September, Pune had gone beyond two and a half lakhs.
The lockdown was relaxed, processions did not start during Ganeshotsav but crowds were seen on the streets of Pune.
But is there any reason to get infected here faster than other cities?
The climate in Pune is similar to that of swine flu.
Jumbo Covid Center Pune
But at the same time, Pune is the most tested city in the country for every one million population, so they think the numbers are big.
The other part is reporting bias or surveillance bias.
Now if you look, Pune is doing about 95000 tests for every one million population in the state.
Corona virus: Decrease in slum infections in Mumbai - CIRO Survey

Corona drug: Do not give remedivir to anyone - WHO instructions
The World Health Organization (WHO) has advised that patients with covidia should not be given remedivir, no matter how severe their condition.
Although no effective drug is still available on Covid 19, remedivir has been used to treat critically ill patients from the very beginning.
How effective is remedivir?
Solidarity trials conducted by the WHO in October found that remedivir did little to cure covid patients, prevent their deaths, or reduce their need for a ventilator.
But Gilead Pharmaceuticals, a US-based manufacturer of remedies, rejected the findings.
While approving the use of the drug in the United States, the FDA had said that the drug, remedicivir, sold under the brand name Veclary, reduces the healing rate of covid patients by five days.
The FDA said the drug could be used "in adults as well as in children over 12 years of age and in hospitalized patients weighing at least 40 kg".
US President Donald Trump was also given ramadesivir during treatment after contracting covid.
The FDA said three different clinical trials of the drug had yielded good results.
Use of Remedesivir in Maharashtra
Remadesivir was widely used on covid patients in Maharashtra.
Only then did the director of ICMR, Dr. Balram Bhargava had also said, "Four drugs were tested for remedial treatment.
Now, however, the WHO has made it clear that it does not make sense to use Remedesivir because it does not have sufficient evidence to suggest that it actually works.
But in many parts of the country, including Maharashtra, remedivir is still given to some serious patients.
Speaking to BBC Marathi's Mayank Bhagwat, Maharashtra Covid Task Force member Dr. Shashank Joshi said, "Four months ago, the task force issued instructions to all doctors on the proper use of Remedesivir.
Therefore, the doctor treating the patient should identify and treat the patient whether he / she needs remedivir. "
The use of remedivir in the state has been significantly reduced following the recommendations made by the task force.

Corona Lockdown: Signs of Lockdown Again in Maharashtra for 8 Reasons?
Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has appealed to the people to be more vigilant in view of the increasing number of corona patients.
Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has appealed to the people to abide by the rules.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also convened a meeting of chief ministers of eight states where the number of corona patients is increasing.
Corona outbreaks are on the rise in Delhi, while corona outbreaks in Ahmedabad have led to night curfews.
An increase in the number of patients for five days in a row
More than 5,000 new patients were registered in Maharashtra for five consecutive days.
In six to seven days till November 17, less than 5,000 patients were registered in Maharashtra.
So far, 17 lakh 80 thousand 208 people have been infected with corona in Maharashtra.
Speaking about this, the survey officer of the state health department, Dr. Speaking to BBC Marathi, Pradip Awate said, "The number of corona patients was less during Diwali because the testing was less during the festive season.
Possibility of another lockdown in Maharashtra?
After Diwali, the number of corona patients is increasing in Maharashtra.
Until the first two weeks of November, the number of patients receiving corona free every 24 hours was higher than the number of new patients.
When asked about the lockdown, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar said that he would take a decision based on the situation.
On the other hand, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has not spoken clearly about the lockdown, but after Delhi and Gujarat, there may be another wave in Maharashtra, so he has warned to be careful.
Corona infection is now spreading among the youth and through them the corona infection is reaching the senior citizens and this is a matter of concern, said Uddhav Thackeray.
Even if the people of Maharashtra are to be vaccinated twice, 24-25 crore people will have to be vaccinated.
Due to this situation, restrictions are likely to be imposed on some things in Maharashtra once again.
'The wise behind the next'
After Gujarat, Delhi is once again facing a lockdown.
During Diwali, a large number of people left their homes.
Dr. Pradeep Awate says, "We are only expressing the possibility of a lockdown.
The decision to lockdown is a decision that needs to be taken in a holistic way.
Is lockdown a viable option?
The lockdown was enforced for five to six consecutive months in the country, including the state.
The economic situation of the state is not much different.
According to doctors, it is no longer affordable to implement lockdown to control patient numbers.
The clinical director of Fortis Hospital, Dr. Speaking to BBC Marathi, Rahul Pandit said, "If the number of corona patients continues to rise, there is a real fear of a lockdown.
The survey officer of the state health department, Dr. Pradip Awate also agrees with this view.
He says, "The side effects of lockdown are as devastating as illness.
More care since winter
In Maharashtra, almost all matters under 'Mission Begin' have been opened under certain rules.
In metropolitan cities like Mumbai and Pune, we see a blanket of smoke on a cold day.
This is also the reason for the rapid spread of flu in winter.
Now that winter is coming, lung diseases are likely to increase.
Due to these reasons, the infection increased in Maharashtra
We asked doctors and administrative officials what was the reason for the steady increase in the number of corona in the state.
1) Unlock - Unlock opened shops, hotels, transportation system, markets.
2) Diwali - On the occasion of Diwali, people came in contact with people longer than before.
3) Delay in testing of people who come in contact with the patient - Initially, a patient was found to be positive that the administration was taking information of everyone who came in contact with him.
4) Less contact tracing - Doctors say, if an asymptomatic patient comes to us, we send him to the concerned Corona Hospital.
5) Non-use of mask - In Maharashtra, if the mask is not used, punitive action has been decided.
6) Ignoring cold-cough - Due to rains and constant change in the weather, the incidence of cold, cough and fever has increased.
7) Do not do RT PCR test - Corona's RT PCR is expected to be tested again after the antigen test is negative.
8) Lack of Sanitation - If a corona patient is found in a housing society, the area needs to be sanitized. But the proportion has also come down now.
States will have to get Centre's permission for lockdown, are the new rules
Corona has surrounded the police.
No state can declare a lockdown in a state, city or taluka outside the containment zone without consulting the central government.
The decision on the lockdown will be taken only after discussions with the Center.
A second wave of corona virus is feared in the country.
Speaking on the occasion, the Chief Minister said, "If there is no need for re-imposition of restrictions, the people should abide by the Trisutri and if some exceptions are left, most of the people are abiding by it.
The Union Health Department had said that people need to be extra careful during the festive season and winter.
Guidelines issued by the Central Government to the States:
The state government may impose restrictions like ‘night curfew’ in the city to control corona as per the situation.
Social distance should be made mandatory in the office.
Cities with a corona growth rate of 10 percent should make the decision to change office hours and implement it appropriately.
The number of people working in the office at the same time should be controlled
There will be no restrictions on inter-state and two-state travel.
There are no restrictions on transportation of goods.

There is no lockdown in Maharashtra but these restrictions have to be complied with
Corona patients are once again on the rise in the state.
It is feared that there will be a tsunami, not another wave of corona, said Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray.

Rapidly increasing cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases is showing similar trends in European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom confirming that, while at a different stage depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for a surge of patients with COVID-19 who will require healthcare, and in particular intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the causative agent as being a novel coronavirus now referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since, the illness resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date is that ca 80% of individuals with COVID-19 have a mild disease, i.e. a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and most of these recover.
In ca 14% cases, COVID-19 develops into a more severe disease requiring hospitalisation while the remaining 6% cases experience critical illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality of patients hospitalised due to COVID-19 is ca 4%.
In this study, we assess the trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) country and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare them to that of Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with that in Italy during 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
Subsequent to China, COVID-19 underwent further geographical spread and the dynamic of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world currently follows that of this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the 5 March issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported on the first European confirmed COVID-19 cases according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in persons returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As at 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), whereby between 31 December 2019 and that date included, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths had been reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Obtaining cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the notified COVID-19 case counts in each country worldwide, obtained from only official sources such as the countries’ Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities and the WHO, are updated each day at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used for assessing the trends of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and the UK, and comparing them to that in Italy.
As a proxy of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the 14-day truncated cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases, thus taking into account the natural course of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and the UK, during the 1 January–15 March 2020 period.
We also presented the cumulative number of notified cases of each country as at 15 March 2020 8:00 a.m. compared with that of Italy for the 31 January–15 March 2020 period.
Trends of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The trends in the 14-day truncated cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally followed that of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK overall, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 started to increase around 21 February and then increased sharply around 28 February 2020 (Supplementary material).
This was mostly driven by the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed similar increasing trends of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (Supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases, in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared with that in Italy for the 31 January–15 March 2020 period.
It highlights that, as at 15 March 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy just 3 weeks prior or less.
Our results indicate that the number of notified cases of COVID-19 is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a comparable speed in all countries.
This is despite countries being at different stages, variations in national public health responses, and possibly different case definitions in countries and different protocols for selecting patients that must be tested for confirmation of COVID-19, including catch-up testing.
Early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which ca 10% of patients with COVID-19 required intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admission of COVID-19 cases in a hospital and/or an intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% cases, respectively (data not shown).
They should, however, be collected in a systematic fashion to complement current surveillance data that focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study performed in 2010–11 showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 population in 2010–11).
Modelling scenarios related to healthcare capacity saturation, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the UK of the prevalence of hospitalised COVID-19 cases associated with a &gt; 90% risk of exceeding intensive care bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
Since cases have so far clustered in certain regions in EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve a defined regional catchment population, information about cases and intensive care beds should preferably be made available at the Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics 2 (NUTS-2) level.
The experience from Italy and the current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should thus prepare themselves for a scenario of sustained community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 requiring healthcare, and in particular intensive care, such as the one occurring in the affected regions of Italy.
As pointed out in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, with a shift from a containment to a mitigation approach, as the anticipated rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide decision makers and hospitals enough time to comprehend, accept and adapt their response accordingly if not implemented ahead of time.
The rapid risk assessment also lists the public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window of opportunity during which countries have the possibility to further increase their control efforts to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and decrease the pressure on healthcare.
Failing this, it is likely that the healthcare systems of other EU/EEA countries will face a surge of patients that require intensive care within the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has thus far killed over 3,000 people and infected over 80,000 in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in catastrophe for humans.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 might also be transmitted from the bats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS but is much more transmissive and affects more elderly individuals than youth and more men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on the emerging disease, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the swiftly developing research subject.
We will cover the basics about the epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of the disease.
Although many questions still require answers, we hope that this review helps in the understanding and eradication of the threatening disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory to all Chinese who were urged to stay indoors for all the holiday and for many weeks after due to the outbreak of a novel viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; thus, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the associated disease was named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic started in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the entire country and to near 50 others all over the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has resulted in over 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged and over 3,000 patients who died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is “public enemy number 1” and potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, over 200 papers have been published on COVID-19 including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment since the first report on January 7, 2020 that determined the sequence of the virus isolated from multiple patients.
This review attempts to summarize the research progress in the new and swiftly developing subject area.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another CoV-caused disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far regarding the prevention and prognosis of the disease as well as some remaining yet urgent questions.
CoVs have been traditionally considered nonlethal pathogens to humans, mainly causing approximately 15% of common colds 4.
However, in this century, we have encountered highly pathogenic human CoVs twice, i.e., SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an outbreak originally in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with horrible morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV outbreak in the recorded history of humans.
As shown in Fig. ​Fig.1,1, clusters of pneumonia that had unknown origins were first reported from Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the China National Health Commission.
Seven days later the sequence of the CoV was released.
On January 15, 2020 the first fatal case from Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic rapidly spread to the neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, the infection of health-care providers was reported, suggesting that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was locked down with all its public transportation stopped.
On January 24 the first clinical study on the disease reported that, out of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market that was considered the starting site of the infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
By the time of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and near 50 other countries all over the world (Fig. ​(Fig.2).2).
As the situation is rapidly evolving, the final scope and severity of the outbreak remain to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-center study on 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients presented a more updated illustration of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mainly at the age of 30-65.
Almost half (47.7%) of the infected individuals were over 50 years old, very few were under 20, and only 14 infected individuals were under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 expanded in clusters mainly in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before 23 Jan. 2020, matching the time of massive transportation before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all the patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
Three major risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (male), age (≥60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large and enveloped viruses containing a single strand of sense RNA.
They can be divided into four genera, i.e., alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alpha- and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.
The envelope spike (S) glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, genomic RNA accompanied by envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins forms virion-containing vesicles, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of beta-CoV with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequenced samples collected from the original site of the outbreak, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
Through transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in ultrathin sections of human airway epithelium.
Human ACE2 was found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 more weakly than that of SARS-CoV, which is coincident with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a novel short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in the viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNβ; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., reported the cryo-EM structure of the full-length human ACE2 at 2.9 Å resolution in complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, which provides evidence for CoV recognition and infection.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The origin and intermediate host
It has been known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans via civet cats and camels, respectively.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were considered the native host of SARS-CoV-2 as the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like CoVs from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, what intermediate host helped the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans remains unknown, and the transmission route is yet to be elucidated.
Ji, et al., proposed snakes as a carrier of the virus from bats to humans which involved homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolins - long-snouted, ant-eating mammals often used in traditional Chinese medicine - are the potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic homology in a CoV discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, 1% difference spread all over two genomes is still a big difference; thus, conclusive results for concrete evidence are awaited (Fig. ​(Fig.33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely not yet known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days under 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may possess similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant, peracetic acid, chloroform, and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.
The entire human population generally lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and hence is susceptible to the novel virus.
Currently, no detailed study has been reported regarding the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. ​(Fig.4).4).
In general, after a virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the host innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, maturation of dendritic cells, and synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) which limit the spreading of the virus and accelerate macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus escape from the immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play an important role in the defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
T helper cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help the defending cells.
However, CoV can inhibit T cell functions by inducing apoptosis of T cells.
The humoral immunity including complements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies is also essential in combating the viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system generates a large number of free radicals locally that can cause severe damages to the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst scenario, multi-organ failure and even death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, featured by clustering onset, is more likely to affect elderly people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common that for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised, they have higher chance to be infected than others.
The estimated mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study on 1,099 cases demonstrates that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, demonstrates that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on the demography of 8,866 cases.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period, thus preventing infected but symptomless people from transmitting the virus to others.
As a common practice, individuals exposed to, or infected by, the virus are usually required to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine time be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the major and initial symptom of COVID-19, which can be accompanied by no symptom or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle ache, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experienced dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients quickly progressed to develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without pulmonary imaging abnormalities, should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December of 2019 showed that the percentages of the symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of the patients required ventilation support.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family cluster and a cluster caused by transmission from an asymptomatic individual.
Comparably, a demographic study in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of them required ventilation support, much more than COVID-19 patients and consistent with the higher lethality of MERS than of COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed with MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it has been demonstrated that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were the major symptoms and ventilation support was required for approximately 14%-20% of the patients.
By February 14, the mortality of COVID-19 was 2% when the confirmed cases reached 66,576 globally.
Comparably, the mortality of SARS by November 2002 was 10% of 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, the mortality was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
An earlier study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, whereas the R0 of SARS-CoV only ranged from 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV regarding their symptoms, mortality, and R0 is presented in Table ​Table1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher ability to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less lethal than the latter two.
Thus, it is much more challenging to control the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 than those of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Clustered onset often happens in the same family or from the same gathering or vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected individuals or patients in the recent two weeks before the onset.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms longer than two weeks and cured patients discharged from hospitals can carry the virus again, which sends out an alarm to increase the time for quarantine.
Patients have normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) at the early stage.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count &lt; 4×109/L including lymphocyte count &lt; 1×109/L, and elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels and viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin were increased in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of D-dimer, a fibrin degradation product present in the blood, was elevated, and lymphocyte count was progressively reduced.
Abnormalities in chest radiography are found in most COVID-19 patients and featured by bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop an atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS happens, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis severely compromise the gas exchange.
Dysfunction of type-I and type-II pneumocytes decreases the surfactant level and increases surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and heightening the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the worst chest radiographic findings often parallel the most severe extent of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the desquamation of pneumocytes, hyaline membrane formation, and interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, and multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS and similar to that of SARS and MERS patients.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the major criteria for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false-negative rate, which may accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations started to be used for diagnosis (which no longer solely relied on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is essential and imperative for making an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol of using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of input) using a dipstick in less than an hour without requiring elaborate instrumentation.
Hopefully, the new technique can dramatically enhance the sensitivity and convenience if verified in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the novel CoV, physicians can mainly provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while attempting a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed before for the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table ​(Table2).2).
These therapies include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from recovered patients was proposed to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs in the beginning and probably also attacks, to a lesser degree, other organs that express ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
Nevertheless, respiratory dysfunction and failure are the major threat to the patients and the major cause of death.
Thus, respiratory support is critical to relieve the symptoms and save lives and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms have to be supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used for the treatment of life-threatening cardiac or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infection and septic shock, and the protection of the functions of the vital organs are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It has been known that a cytokine storm results from an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response featured by the release of a series of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a vast number of free radicals which are the major cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine storm include the modulation of T cell-directed immune response; the blockade of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; suppressor of cytokine signaling 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids at high dosages were not beneficial to severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they may cause severe side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, dramatically affecting the prognosis.
Nevertheless, short courses of corticosteroids at low-to-moderate doses have been recommended to be used prudently for critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration with remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, has been found to be efficacious in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also demonstrated possible inhibition of other single stranded RNA viruses including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these, Gilead has provided the compound to China to conduct a pair of trials on SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other adverse reactions can occur following combined therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in the patients should be monitored carefully.
Plasma from recovered patients and antibody generation
The collection of the blood from patients who recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from catching the disease has a long history.
Indeed, recovered patients often have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects and they recognize unique molecules in the pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and was injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation and viral loads and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary to propose the method for large-scale use before specific therapies are not yet developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some disadvantages associated with the plasma should be considered carefully.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially a life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for the plasma is large to treat critically ill patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies rapidly enough to fight against a global epidemic.
Thus, it is more critical and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic codes encoding effective antibodies or screen for effective antibodies against essential proteins of the virus.
This way, we can readily scale up the production of the antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat a variety of diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects largely rely on a combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on the theories of TCM.
Most of the effective components remain unknown or are vague as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the major alternative treatments for patients with light to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective for COVID-19 treatment.
Top cure rates in the treatment of COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces in China that used TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), whereas Hubei province, which used TCM in only approximately 30% of its COVID-19 patients, had the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is quite a rough comparison as many other impact factors such as the number and severity of the patients should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and coworkers published a study to compare western medicine (WM) treatment alone with combined treatment of WM and TCM.
They found that the times needed for body temperature recovery, symptom disappearance, and hospitalization were remarkably shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM only group.
Most impressively, the rate for symptomatic worsening (from light to severe) was remarkably lower for the WM+TCM group than for the WM only group (7.4% versus 46.2%) and the mortality was lower in the WM+TCM group than WM only group (8.8% versus 39%).
Nevertheless, the efficacy and safety of TCM still await more well-controlled trials at larger scales and in more centers.
It would also be intriguing to characterize the mechanism of actions and clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations if possible.
Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 mostly experience great fear of the highly contagious and even fatal disease, and quarantined people also experience boredom, loneliness, and anger.
Furthermore, symptoms of the infection such as fever, hypoxia, and cough as well as adverse effects of the treatments such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to more anxiety and mental distress.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a range of psychiatric morbidities including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidality were reported.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine, as a part of the public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people more anxious and guilty about the effects of the contagion, quarantine, and stigma on their families and friends.
Thus, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected individuals, and people in contact with them as well as the general public who are in need.
The psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communications with regular and accurate updates about the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are essential for interrupting the chain of transmission from animal reservoirs and infected humans to susceptible hosts and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines to generate long-term and potent neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live-attenuated vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these vaccine candidates in elderly individuals and lethal-challenge models and their protection against zoonotic virus infection have yet to be determined before a clinical study is initiated.
This is probably because SARS died down 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since.
In contrast, sporadic cases and clusters of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions owing to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS by using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and critical task for controlling the ongoing epidemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome the difficulty because of the long period of time (averaged 18 months) needed for vaccine development and the dynamic variations of CoVs.
As a novel disease, COVID-19 has just started to manifest its full clinical course throughout thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually without sequelae.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, building a prognosis model for the disease is essential for health-care agencies to prioritize their services, especially in resource-constrained areas.
Based on clinical studies reported thus far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table ​(Table33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly happened at the age of 30-65 with 47.7% of those patients being over 50 in a study of 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients who required intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications and were significantly older than those who did not (at the median age of 66 versus 51), suggesting age as a prognostic factor for the outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute cardiac injury and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the main reason for death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which might lead to liver dysfunctions in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age and underlying disease are strongly correlated and might interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: The C-reactive protein (CRP) level in blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed to be a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy, and ultimate recovery.
The correlation of CRP level to the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
In addition, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are expressed extensively in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Thus, they are traditional markers for heart or liver dysfunctions.
Major clinical symptoms: Chest radiography and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered together with the other issues for the prediction of outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressant commonly used as an adjunctive therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since a high dosage of corticosteroids was widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors suffered from avascular osteonecrosis with life-long disability and poor life quality.
Thus, if needed, steroids should be used at low dosage and for a short time in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak many patients have suffered from extraordinary stress as they often endured long periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty and witnessed the death of close family members and fellow patients.
It is imperative to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help these patients recover from the stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 seems to have different epidemiological features from SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory tract and causes mild or no symptoms in the early phase of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause common colds.
Therefore, infected patients at the early phase or incubation period can produce a large amount of virus during daily activities, causing great difficulty for the control of the epidemic.
However, the transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to occur when the patients are severely ill, while most transmission did not happen at the early phase.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the outbreak of SARS.
Great efforts are currently underway in China including the lockdown of Wuhan and surrounding cities and continuous quarantine of almost the entire population in hopes of interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions have been dramatically damaging the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is declining, indicating the slowdown of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the downswing phase will last for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not that optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which seems substantially more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both mid-turbinate and throat swabs of patients who recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, which indicates that the newly identified virus could become a cyclical episode similar to influenza.
However, promising signs have occurred in China based on the declining number of new cases, indicating the current strategies might have been working.
Ebola was originally predicted to cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, via strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has eventually been put under control.
It is possible, similar to SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 might become weaker in infectivity and eventually die down or become a less pathogenic virus co-existent with humans.
A comparison of the epidemic of COVID-19 with that of SARS and MERS is provided below (Fig. ​(Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmittable through coughing or sneezing, and possibly also through direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also found in feces, which raises a new possibility of feces-to-mouth transmission.
A recent study on 138 cases reported that 41% of the cases were possibly caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with other prior diseases and 40 health-care providers.
Thus, great precaution should be used to protect humans, especially health-care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even bystanders in contact with patients or infected people.
The first line of defense that could be used to lower the risk of infection is through wearing face masks; both the use of surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (series # 1860s) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical face masks prevent liquid droplets from a potentially infected individual from traveling through the air or sticking onto surfaces of materials, where they could be passed on to others.
However, only N95 (series # 1860s) masks can protect against the inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of the virions being able to penetrate completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both are approximately 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate even five surgical masks stacked together, health-care providers in direct contact with patients must wear N95 (series # 1860s) masks but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health-care providers should wear fitted isolation gowns in order to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect an individual through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 although he wore an N95 mask; the virus might have entered his body through his inflammatory eyes.
Thus, health-care providers should also wear transparent face shields or goggles while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly suggested that everybody wash their hands with disinfectant soaps more often than usual, try to stay indoors for self-quarantine and limit contact with potentially infected individuals.
Three feet is considered an appropriate distance for people to stay away from a patient.
These actions are effective methods to lower the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came as a new virus to the human world, its high homology to SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020 should have caused high alert to China based on her deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, not until 19 January 2020 did the director of the Center of Disease Control of Wuhan comfort the citizens by saying that the novel virus has low contagiousness and limited reproductivity from human to human and that it is not a problem to prevent and contain the disease.
This message remarkably relaxed the alarm of the public, especially when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical time was missed to contain the disease at its minimal scale in Wuhan.
The disease control agencies in China may take this hard lesson and make critical improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more careful when making public announcements as every word counts to citizens and can change their attitude and decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive to contain a potential epidemic at its early stage rather than attempting to comfort the public; and (4) more often to issue targeted and effective drills to increase the public's awareness about epidemic diseases and to test and improve the response system of the society periodically.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 started in the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread all over China and near 50 other countries globally at the time of this writing.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has created a sense of SARS recurring.
However, there are some remarkable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for containing the epidemic and treating the patients.
COVID-19 affects more elderly individuals than youth and more men than women, and the severity and death rate are also higher in elderly individual than in youth.
SARS has higher mortality than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they are symptomless whereas SARS patients do so usually when they are severely ill, which causes much greater difficulty to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and broader than SARS-CoV.
The regular RNA assay for SARS-CoV-2 can be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, cured patients can be positive for the virus again.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of virus spreading.
Given such rapid progress in research on COVID-19, several critical issues remain to be solved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic homolog was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat SARS-like CoVs, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is from bats.
What animal was the intermediate species to transmit the virus from the original host, say bats, to humans?
Without knowing answers to #1 and 2, we cannot efficiently cut the transmission, and the outbreak can relapse at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical assays have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the airway cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind ACE2-expressing cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve fast and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How is the virus genetically evolving during transmission among humans?
Will it become a pandemic worldwide, die down like SARS or relapse periodically like the flu?
It is essential but may take some time to search for answers to the above and many other questions.
However, with whatever expense it may demand, we have no other choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and bring our life back to normal.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including human beings, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness, such as common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have flipped the coin to reveal how devastating and life-threatening an HCoV infection could be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has thrusted CoVs into the spotlight again and surprised us with its high transmissibility but reduced pathogenicity compared to its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a zoonosis and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs would serve us well.
Most HCoVs originated from bats where they are non-pathogenic.
The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
Identifying the animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases.
Investigating CoV-host interactions in animals might also derive important insight on CoV pathogenesis in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of the existing knowledge about the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission.
Importantly, we compare and contrast the different HCoVs from a perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination.
The current CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic is discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful host switches and the implications of virus evolution on disease severity are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which comprises a group of enveloped, positive-sensed, single-stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses harbouring the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobases amongst RNA viruses were termed “CoVs” because of their crown-like morphology under electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs have non-segmented genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contain two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins.
The polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins, designated nsp1~16.
The remaining portion of the genome contains ORFs for the structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of lineage-specific accessory proteins are also encoded by different lineages of CoVs.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), among which the beta-CoV genera contains most HCoVs and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents serve as the gene source of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have constantly crossed species barriers and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, like common cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly-identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infection in relatively more patients with a higher chance to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was isolated from the nasal discharge of patients with common cold in mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge was accumulated through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
Indeed, the concept had been widely accepted that infection with HCoVs is generally harmless until the outbreak of SARS.
The SARS outbreak occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating in current history, infecting over 8,000 people with a crude case fatality of approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak resulted in a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spreading to the rest of the world.
The 2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), which has subsequently been renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the ongoing epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm has been ringing and the world has to prepare for the coming pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.
All seven HCoVs have a zoonotic origin from bats, mice or domestic animals.
Multiple lines of evidence support an evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats, where viruses are well adapted and non-pathogenic but show great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has presented enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of HCoVs provides a framework to understand the natural history, driving force and restriction factors of species jumping.
This might also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir, intermediate and amplifying animal host(s) of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications in the prevention of future spillovers.
In this review we present an overview of the zoonotic origins, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of HCoVs.
Particularly, we highlight and discuss the common theme that parental viruses of HCoVs are typically non-pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts but become pathogenic after interspecies transmission to a new host.
We also review the trend of HCoV evolution in which the increase in transmissibility often comes with the decrease in pathogenicity.
The outcome of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since late 1930s.
Before the first isolation of HCoV-229E strain B814 from the nasal discharge of patients who had contracted common cold, different CoVs had been isolated in various infected animals, including turkey, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In the past decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV discovery in chronological order (Table ​1) would be informative and instructive.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in the year of 1966, and was subsequently adapted to grow in WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E presented with common cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, malaise and sore-throat, with fever and cough seen in 10~20% cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage in brains of suckling mice.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which are symptomatically indistinguishable from infection with other respiratory tract pathogens such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed globally, and they tend to be predominantly transmitted during the season of winter in temperate climate.
Generally, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by an approximately 2-week illness.
According to a human volunteer study, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E developed mild common cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients exhibited severe lower respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as “atypical pneumonia”, was the first well documented HCoV-caused pandemic in human history and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province of China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spreading across many countries and continents.
Apart from the super-spreaders, it was estimated that each case could give rise to approximately two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the peak of viral load appearing on the 10th day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially present with myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by dyspnea, cough and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, deranged liver function tests, and elevated creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
Diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and an increase of macrophages are also observed in SARS patients.
Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to lower respiratory tract, multiple organs including gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney can also be infected in these severe cases, usually accompanied with a cytokine storm, which might be lethal particularly in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from the open lung biopsy of a relative of the index patient who travelled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, tremendous efforts have been dedicated to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands during late 2004.
It was initially found to be prevalent in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory illnesses.
Presentation of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal specimen from an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in Netherlands, it is actually distributed globally.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its peak incidence occurs during early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
Besides community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with acute asthmatic exacerbation.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
All these four community-acquired HCoVs have been well adapted to humans and are generally less likely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases, though accidents did occur for unknown reasons as in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in China.
Generally, when these HCoVs acquire the abilities to transmit efficiently and to maintain themselves continuously within humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
Whereas most of the laboratory-confirmed cases originate from the Middle East, imported cases with occasional secondary spreads to close contacts have been reported in various European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
Clinical manifestations of MERS resemble those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which is thus far unique for MERS among HCoV-caused diseases.
More than 30% of patients present with gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, over 2500 laboratory confirmed cases were reported with a high case fatality of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses known to humans.
During middle to late December 2019, clusters of pneumonia patients retrospectively known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and also named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a crude case fatality of 3.4%.
Notably, the case fatality in Hubei, China is 4.2%, whereas the one outside of it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, presented as fever, cough and dyspnea.
Diarrhea is also seen in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to high nucleotide sequence homology of 82%, they cluster into different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic but more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and might contribute to its rapid spreading around the world.
Comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs reveal similarities and differences of great interest.
First, the incubation period and the duration of the course of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits features that are more commonly seen during infection with community-acquired HCoVs, including the presentation of non-specific, mild or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is a bit lower.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns characteristic of both community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoV.
On one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passages in humans as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, same as the other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
Whether fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role as in the case of SARS-CoV at least under some circumstance remains to be clarified by future studies.
It is also of particularly great interest to see whether SARS-CoV-2 might exhibit seasonality as in the cases of community-acquired HCoVs.
Nevertheless, the features of SARS-CoV-2 including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spreading after passages in humans will be influential on the ultimate fate of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.
All four community-acquired HCoVs causing mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it might also be true that humans have been well adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both could be the survivors of ancient HCoV pandemics.
HCoVs that cause severe diseases in humans and humans who developed severe HCoV diseases have been eliminated.
For this to happen, HCoVs have to replicate in humans to sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract host restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people that it infects, the greater chance that it will fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, its transmission in humans would be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four community-acquired CoVs circulate in human populations, triggering common cold in immunocompetent subjects.
These viruses do not need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans well and their transmission within humans cannot be sustained.
They need to maintain and propagate in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek the chance to spillover to susceptible human targets, possibly via one or more intermediate and amplifying hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has features that are similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.
It is highly transmissible like community-acquired HCoVs, at least for the time being.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will adapt fully to humans and circulate within humans without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it will serve us well to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifying hosts of HCoVs.
An animal serves as the evolutionary host of an HCoV if it harbours a closely related ancestor sharing high homology at the level of nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this host.
Likewise, a reservoir host harbours HCoV continuously and for long term.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of HCoV or its parental virus.
In contrast, if the HCoV is newly introduced to an intermediate host right before or around its introduction to humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as the zoonotic source of human infection and play the role of an amplifying host by allowing the virus to replicate transiently and then transmitting it to humans to amplify the scale of human infection.
An HCoV can undergo a dead-end infection if it cannot sustain its transmission within the intermediate host.
On the contrary, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data revealed retrospectively that the index case of SARS had a contact history with game animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence investigations indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared with that of the general population.
Masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and a racoon dog in live animal markets were first identified to carry SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no further SARS was reported after killing all civets in the markets.
However, it has been reported that masked palm civets from the wild or farms without exposure to the live animal markets were largely negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked palm civets might only serve as the intermediate amplifying host but not the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Notably, since 80% of the different animals in the markets in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibilities that multiple species of small mammals might also serve as intermediate amplifying hosts of SARS-CoV cannot be excluded.
All of these appear to be dead-end hosts of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent search for the natural animal host of SARS-CoV unveiled a closely related bat CoV, termed SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese horseshoe bats.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other bat CoVs share 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats host emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified from bats, but none except for one designated WIV1 can be isolated as live virus.
Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be the receptor of SARS-CoV.
WIV1 derived from fecal sample of bats was demonstrated to use bat, civet and human ACE2 as receptor for cell entry.
Intriguingly, sera of convalescent SARS patients were capable of neutralizing WIV1.
Thus far, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Albeit the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV and bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis clusters MERS-CoV to the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV utilize the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are phylogenetically closer to counterparts in bat beta-CoVs identified from Europe and Africa.
Up to now, no live MERS-CoV can be found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative bat CoV-HKU25 share only 87% nucleotide sequence homology.
Thus, bats might not be the immediate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in Middle East have shown that dromedary camels are seropositive for MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, same as camels of Middle East origin in multiple African countries.
Live MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the nasal swabs of dromedary camels, further indicating that camels serve as the bona fide reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
It is also noteworthy that generally mild symptoms but massive virus shedding were observed in camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV.
Notably, infected camels shed viruses not only through respiratory route but also through fecal-oral route, which is also the main route for virus shedding from bats.
However, questions still remain since many confirmed cases of MERS have no contact history with camels prior to symptom onset, plausibly ascribed to human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission routes involving unrecognized animal species that harbour MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with a bat CoV RaTG13 isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too great to assign parental relationship.
That is to say, bats might not be the immediate reservoir host(s) of SARS-CoV-2 unless almost identical bat CoVs are found in future.
Presumably, the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wildlife species sold and killed at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, with which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicative of a probable animal-to-human transmission event.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) could also harbour ancestral beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
These novel pangolin CoV genomes share 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13 with about 90% identity at the level of nucleotide sequence.
They cluster into two sub-lineages of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the phylogenetic tree, one of which share a more similar receptor binding domain (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% amino acid sequence identity.
In stark contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, albeit a higher degree of sequence homology genome-wide.
An earlier study on diseased pangolins also reported the detection of viral contigs from lung samples, which turn out to be similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different assembly methods and manual curation to generate a partial genome sequence comprising about 86.3% of the full-length viral genome.
We cannot exclude the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, currently there is no evidence in support of a direct pangolin origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than that between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals remains to be established.
Whereas the highest sequence homology has been found in the RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest genome-wide sequence homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by selectivity-mediated convergent evolution.
A counter-proposal is in favour of a recombination between a pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is widespread among beta-CoVs.
The jury is still out on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
Besides the highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E might have originated from bat CoVs, while the parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
It has been reported that a bat CoV termed ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in North American tricolored bat displayed close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV, termed Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, while camelids have also been suspected as its intermediate host.
For clarity, the current knowledge on animal origins of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure ​1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for interspecies transmission events of HCoVs in the history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The interspecies transmission history of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Bat alpha-CoVs closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.
Between them there is an alpaca alpha-CoV.
Several lines of evidence support the transmission of virus from bats to humans directly.
First, humans but not alpacas might have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Instead, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E-related bat alpha-CoVs are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, whereas alpaca alpha-CoV caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in feral animals.
Thus, the possibility cannot be excluded that alpacas obtain the HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not too surprising that bats might transmit HCoV-229E to humans directly.
Alternatively, whereas bat alpha-CoVs serve as the gene pool of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedary camels might serve as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known at its initial identification and has also been strengthened by subsequent findings.
It is obvious that bats provide a rich pool of virus species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, densely packed colonies, close social interaction and strong ability to fly are all favourable conditions for bats to be an ideal'virus spreader'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced to dromedary camels for decades.
It is well adapted to these camels that have turned from an intermediate host to a stable and natural reservoir host.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident and humans remain a dead-end host of MERS-CoV as its transmission cannot be sustained.
In contrast to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if there is any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
Particularly, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They might be a dead-end host for SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, similar to civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans have to be ruled in or ruled out in future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans might share the ecological niche with bats through butchering or coal mining.
Second, pangolins could be one of intermediate amplifying host to which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had been newly introduced.
Humans contract the virus through butchering and consumption of game meat.
It is possible that many mammals including domestic animals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A survey of domestic and wild animals for antibodies is warranted.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 might have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is still on.
Apart from different types of the animal hosts, three major factors on the viral side are also important in facilitating CoVs to cross species barriers.
First of all, their relatively high mutation rates in RNA replication.
In comparison to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of CoVs could be regarded as “moderate” to “high” with an average substitution rate being ~10-4 substitution per year per site 2, depending on the phase of CoV adaptation to novel hosts.
CoVs have a proof-reading exoribonuclease, deletion of which results in exceedingly high mutability and attenuation or even inviability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir is known to suppress CoV replication through inhibition of this exoribonuclease and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
Nevertheless, mutation rates of CoVs are about a million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, mutation rate is often high when CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggestive of a higher level of adaptation to humans.
Presumably, it has already been adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedary camels.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic drift would render vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective quickly.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoVs exerts extra plasticity in genome modification for mutations and recombination, thereby increasing the probability for interspecies co-evolution, which is advantageous for the emergence of novel CoVs when the conditions become appropriate.
This is supported by the copious unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded towards the 3′ end of the genome.
Third, CoVs randomly and frequently switch templates during RNA replication through a unique “copy-choice” mechanism.
In a host that serves as the mixing vessel, strand switching occurs frequently during CoV RNA transcription.
Highly homologous full-length and subgenomic RNAs could recombine to generate new CoVs.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in relation to transmission
Besides three viral factors stated above, viral interaction with host receptor is another key factor influential on interspecies transmission.
Herein, recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis between isolates of human and civet SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoV is thought to undergo rapid adaptation in different hosts, particularly with mutations at the RBD of the S protein.
Generally, the RBD in the S protein of a CoV interacts with the cellular receptor and is intensely selected by the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, the RBD is in the 318th to 510th amino acids on the S1 fragment, which binds to the human ACE2 as well as its coreceptors for viral entry.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is capable of recognizing the ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bat, civet, mouse and raccoon dog, allowing interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed to be different from human and civet viral isolates in the RBD and 4 of them locate in the receptor-binding motif for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Civet SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which might increase the affinity of the interaction of spike protein with human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions might be critical to viral adaption to humans.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein implicates that the binding affinity of its S protein with human ACE2 might have altered.
Indeed, a cryo-EM study indicates a 10- to 20-fold higher affinity of this binding than that between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other coreceptor might be required for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Intriguingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with a different part of S.
There exist many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They might also account for successful adaptation of these CoVs in humans after interspecies transmission from their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the outcome of interspecies transmission of HCoVs is also governed by other host dependency and restriction factors.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and natural reservoir hosts of HCoVs such as bats, dromedary camels and rodents might constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoVs have to usurp host dependency factors and subvert host restriction factors for a successful interspecies transmission.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction remain to be identified and characterized.
An unbiased genome-wide screening of host dependency and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using the state-of-the-art technology of CRISPR might be fruitful.
Emergence of novel HCoVs: back to ground zero
The diversity of bat CoVs provides ample opportunities for the emergence of novel HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs serve as the gene pool of HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of novel protein-coding genes has the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 has been thought to be important in adaptation to humans, as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated but found to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
A 29-nucleotide deletion characteristic of SARS-CoVs has been found in strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes the switch of hosts.
Besides, SARS-CoV has a possible recombination history with lineages of alpha- and gamma-CoVs, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions were identified in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination locations were also identified in the nsp9, most of nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Likewise, it has been shown that the epidemic MERS-CoV experienced recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia.
Besides SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs, in which the HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be cautioned that artificial selection can contribute to unintended changes in viral genomes, most likely resulting from relieving viruses from selection pressures exerted, such as by the host immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain, owing to a two-nucleotide deletion.
While intact ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, the alpaca alpha-CoV displays a single nucleotide insertion, resulting in a frameshift.
Last but not least, the evolution of novel HCoVs is also driven by the selection pressure in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic or only mild symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoVs, indicating the mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It appeared that bats are well adapted to CoVs anatomically and physiologically.
For example, defects in the activation of pro-inflammatory response in bats efficiently reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.
Besides, the natural killer cell activity in bats is suppressed due to upregulation of inhibitory natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and low expression level of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules.
Moreover, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress CoV replication and affects proofreading by exoribonuclease, thus providing the selection pressure for the generation of virus strains highly pathogenic when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains might also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of novel proteins or protein features for host adaptation.
Thus, it is not by chance that three novel HCoVs have emerged in the past two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate robustly without eliciting a strong host immune response.
Herein lie the secrets of why asymptomatic carriers are seen and what causes the severe cases in human infection.
The severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of immune response and the cytokine storm wherein the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been de-coupled from CoV replication.
The same strategy of delinking the immune response might have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, NLRP3 inflammasome activation in bats is defective.
By this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 might be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general theme by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV arose.
Whereas a bat beta-CoV sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been found, there also exists a bat-CoV sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Whereas civets and other animals in the markets have been found to harbour viruses identical to SARS-CoV, immediate intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Pangolin beta-CoVs strikingly homologous to SARS-CoV-2 have been found, indicating that pangolins might serve as one of intermediate hosts or pangolin beta-CoVs could contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is man-made either deliberately or accidentally.
CoVs have returned to the limelight due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has drastically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of HCoVs in human transmission.
Pervasive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have a bat origin and are transmitted to humans via intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection originates from the contact between humans and civets in the markets, closing wet markets and killing civets therein could have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
By the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, in view of the discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin beta-CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals remain to be clarified in future investigations.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in dromedary camels for a long time.
These camels serve as an important tool for transportation as well as a main source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local people.
They are widely distributed across the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels for the control of MERS, as what was done in wild animal markets in China to prevent the spreading of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
As we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes might emerge to cause outbreaks.
A variety of zoonotic CoVs are circulating in the wild.
Particularly, bat CoVs with zoonotic potential are so diverse.
There are plenty of opportunities that these zoonotic CoVs evolve and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or deadly in humans in future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the ordeals of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be in place.
In fact, many viruses have existed in the planet for a very long time.
They stay in their own natural reservoirs until there is a chance for spillover.
Although bats have many features that favours the spreading of viruses, the chance for humans to be in contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if people are educated to stay away from them.
Continuous surveillance in mammals is necessary for better understanding of the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is for humans to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of the zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces in the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral virus of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it will be of interest to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, how humans get into contact with bats should be determined.
Third, if a third mammal acts as the true intermediate host, how it interacts with the different species including humans, bats and pangolins has to be clarified.
Finally, since many mammals including domestic animals might be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be conducted.
Should it be a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parental viruses that are almost identical will be identified in its natural hosts in future.
Continued investigations in this area will elucidate the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Preliminary Estimates of the Prevalence of Selected Underlying Health Conditions Among Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 — United States, February 12–March 28, 2020
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic.
As of March 28, 2020, a total of 571,678 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 26,494 deaths have been reported worldwide.
Reports from China and Italy suggest that risk factors for severe disease include older age and the presence of at least one of several underlying health conditions.
U.S. older adults, including those aged ≥65 years and particularly those aged ≥85 years, also appear to be at higher risk for severe COVID-19–associated outcomes; however, data describing underlying health conditions among U.S. COVID-19 patients have not yet been reported.
As of March 28, 2020, U.S. states and territories have reported 122,653 U.S. COVID-19 cases to CDC, including 7,162 (5.8%) for whom data on underlying health conditions and other known risk factors for severe outcomes from respiratory infections were reported.
Among these 7,162 cases, 2,692 (37.6%) patients had one or more underlying health condition or risk factor, and 4,470 (62.4%) had none of these conditions reported.
The percentage of COVID-19 patients with at least one underlying health condition or risk factor was higher among those requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission (358 of 457, 78%) and those requiring hospitalization without ICU admission (732 of 1,037, 71%) than that among those who were not hospitalized (1,388 of 5,143, 27%).
The most commonly reported conditions were diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, and cardiovascular disease.
These preliminary findings suggest that in the United States, persons with underlying health conditions or other recognized risk factors for severe outcomes from respiratory infections appear to be at a higher risk for severe disease from COVID-19 than are persons without these conditions.
Data from laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to CDC from 50 states, four U.S. territories and affiliated islands, the District of Columbia, and New York City with February 12–March 28, 2020 onset dates were analyzed.
Cases among persons repatriated to the United States from Wuhan, China, and the Diamond Princess cruise ship were excluded.
For cases with missing onset dates, date of onset was estimated by subtracting 4 days (median interval from symptom onset to specimen collection date among cases with known dates in these data) from the earliest specimen collection.
Public health departments reported cases to CDC using a standardized case report form that captures information (yes, no, or unknown) on the following conditions and potential risk factors: chronic lung disease (inclusive of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], and emphysema); diabetes mellitus; cardiovascular disease; chronic renal disease; chronic liver disease; immunocompromised condition; neurologic disorder, neurodevelopmental, or intellectual disability; pregnancy; current smoking status; former smoking status; or other chronic disease.
Data reported to CDC are preliminary and can be updated by health departments over time; critical data elements might be missing at the time of initial report; thus, this analysis is descriptive, and no statistical comparisons could be made.
The percentages of patients of all ages with underlying health conditions who were not hospitalized, hospitalized without ICU admission, and hospitalized with ICU admission were calculated.
Percentages of hospitalizations with and without ICU admission were estimated for persons aged ≥19 years with and without underlying health conditions.
This part of the analysis was limited to persons aged ≥19 years because of the small sample size of cases in children with reported underlying health conditions (N = 32).
To account for missing data among these preliminary reports, ranges were estimated with a lower bound including cases with both known and unknown status for hospitalization with and without ICU admission as the denominator and an upper bound using only cases with known outcome status as the denominator.
Because of small sample size and missing data on underlying health conditions among COVID-19 patients who died, case-fatality rates for persons with and without underlying conditions were not estimated.
As of March 28, 2020, a total of 122,653 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases (Figure) and 2,112 deaths were reported to CDC.
Case report forms were submitted to CDC for 74,439 (60.7%) cases.
Data on presence or absence of underlying health conditions and other recognized risk factors for severe outcomes from respiratory infections (i.e., smoking and pregnancy) were available for 7,162 (5.8%) patients (Table 1).
Approximately one third of these patients (2,692, 37.6%), had at least one underlying condition or risk factor.
Diabetes mellitus (784, 10.9%), chronic lung disease (656, 9.2%), and cardiovascular disease (647, 9.0%) were the most frequently reported conditions among all cases.
Among 457 ICU admissions and 1,037 non-ICU hospitalizations, 358 (78%) and 732 (71%), respectively occurred among persons with one or more reported underlying health condition.
In contrast, 1,388 of 5,143 (27%) COVID-19 patients who were not hospitalized were reported to have at least one underlying health condition.
Among patients aged ≥19 years, the percentage of non-ICU hospitalizations was higher among those with underlying health conditions (27.3%–29.8%) than among those without underlying health conditions (7.2%–7.8%); the percentage of cases that resulted in an ICU admission was also higher for those with underlying health conditions (13.3%–14.5%) than those without these conditions (2.2%–2.4%) (Table 2).
Small numbers of COVID-19 patients aged &lt; 19 years were reported to be hospitalized (48) or admitted to an ICU (eight).
In contrast, 335 patients aged &lt; 19 years were not hospitalized and 1,342 had missing data on hospitalization.
Among all COVID-19 patients with complete information on underlying conditions or risk factors, 184 deaths occurred (all among patients aged ≥19 years); 173 deaths (94%) were reported among patients with at least one underlying condition.
Among 122,653 U.S. COVID-19 cases reported to CDC as of March 28, 2020, 7,162 (5.8%) patients had data available pertaining to underlying health conditions or potential risk factors; among these patients, higher percentages of patients with underlying conditions were admitted to the hospital and to an ICU than patients without reported underlying conditions.
These results are consistent with findings from China and Italy, which suggest that patients with underlying health conditions and risk factors, including, but not limited to, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, COPD, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic renal disease, and smoking, might be at higher risk for severe disease or death from COVID-19.
This analysis was limited by small numbers and missing data because of the burden placed on reporting health departments with rapidly rising case counts, and these findings might change as additional data become available.
It is not yet known whether the severity or level of control of underlying health conditions affects the risk for severe disease associated with COVID-19.
Many of these underlying health conditions are common in the United States: based on self-reported 2018 data, the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes among U.S. adults was 10.1%, and the U.S. age-adjusted prevalence of all types of heart disease (excluding hypertension without other heart disease) was 10.6% in 2017.
The age-adjusted prevalence of COPD among U.S. adults is 5.9%, and in 2018, the U.S. estimated prevalence of current asthma among persons of all ages was 7.9%.
CDC continues to develop and update resources for persons with underlying health conditions to reduce the risk of acquiring COVID-19.
The estimated higher prevalence of these conditions among those in this early group of U.S. COVID-19 patients and the potentially higher risk for more severe disease from COVID-19 associated with the presence of underlying conditions highlight the importance of COVID-19 prevention in persons with underlying conditions.
The findings in this report are subject to at least six limitations.
First, these data are preliminary, and the analysis was limited by missing data related to the health department reporting burden associated with rapidly rising case counts and delays in completion of information requiring medical chart review; these findings might change as additional data become available.
Information on underlying conditions was only available for 7,162 (5.8%) of 122,653 cases reported to CDC.
It cannot be assumed that those with missing information are similar to those with data on either hospitalizations or underlying health conditions.
Second, these data are subject to bias in outcome ascertainment because of short follow-up time.
Some outcomes might be underestimated, and long-term outcomes cannot be assessed in this analysis.
Third, because of the limited availability of testing in many jurisdictions during this period, this analysis is likely biased toward more severe cases, and findings might change as testing becomes more widespread.
Fourth, because of the descriptive nature of these data, attack rates among persons with and without underlying health conditions could not be compared, and thus the risk difference of severe disease with COVID-19 between these groups could not be estimated.
Fifth, no conclusions could be drawn about underlying conditions that were not included in the case report form or about different conditions that were reported in a single, umbrella category.
For example, asthma and COPD were included in a chronic lung disease category.
Finally, for some underlying health conditions and risk factors, including neurologic disorders, chronic liver disease, being a current smoker, and pregnancy, few severe outcomes were reported; therefore, conclusions cannot be drawn about the risk for severe COVID-19 among persons in these groups.
Persons in the United States with underlying health conditions appear to be at higher risk for more severe COVID-19, consistent with findings from other countries.
Persons with underlying health conditions who have symptoms of COVID-19, including fever, cough, or shortness of breath, should immediately contact their health care provider.
These persons should take steps to protect themselves from COVID-19, through washing their hands; cleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces; and social distancing, including staying at home, avoiding crowds, gatherings, and travel, and avoiding contact with persons who are ill.
Maintaining at least a 30-day supply of medication, a 2-week supply of food and other necessities, and knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms are recommended for those with underlying health conditions.
All persons should take steps to protect themselves from COVID-19 and to protect others.
All persons who are ill should stay home, except to get medical care; should not go to work; and should stay away from others.
This is especially important for those who work with persons with underlying conditions or who otherwise are at high risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19.
Community mitigation strategies, which aim to slow the spread of COVID-19, are important to protect all persons from COVID-19, especially persons with underlying health conditions and other persons at risk for severe COVID-19–associated disease (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/community-mitigation-strategy.pdf).
What is already known about this topic?
Published reports from China and Italy suggest that risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease include underlying health conditions, but data describing underlying health conditions among U.S. COVID-19 patients have not yet been reported.
What is added by this report?
Based on preliminary U.S. data, persons with underlying health conditions such as diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, and cardiovascular disease, appear to be at higher risk for severe COVID-19–associated disease than persons without these conditions.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Strategies to protect all persons and especially those with underlying health conditions, including social distancing and handwashing, should be implemented by all communities and all persons to help slow the spread of COVID-19.
Emergence of a Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19): Protocol for Extending Surveillance Used by the Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre and Public Health England
The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) and Public Health England (PHE) have successfully worked together on the surveillance of influenza and other infectious diseases for over 50 years, including three previous pandemics.
With the emergence of the international outbreak of the coronavirus infection (COVID-19), a UK national approach to containment has been established to test people suspected of exposure to COVID-19.
At the same time and separately, the RCGP RSC’s surveillance has been extended to monitor the temporal and geographical distribution of COVID-19 infection in the community as well as assess the effectiveness of the containment strategy.
The aims of this study are to surveil COVID-19 in both asymptomatic populations and ambulatory cases with respiratory infections, ascertain both the rate and pattern of COVID-19 spread, and assess the effectiveness of the containment policy.
The RCGP RSC, a network of over 500 general practices in England, extract pseudonymized data weekly.
This extended surveillance comprises of five components: (1) Recording in medical records of anyone suspected to have or who has been exposed to COVID-19.
Computerized medical records suppliers have within a week of request created new codes to support this.
(2) Extension of current virological surveillance and testing people with influenza-like illness or lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI)—with the caveat that people suspected to have or who have been exposed to COVID-19 should be referred to the national containment pathway and not seen in primary care.
(3) Serology sample collection across all age groups.
This will be an extra blood sample taken from people who are attending their general practice for a scheduled blood test.
The 100 general practices currently undertaking annual influenza virology surveillance will be involved in the extended virological and serological surveillance.
(4) Collecting convalescent serum samples.
We have the opportunity to escalate the data extraction to twice weekly if needed.
Swabs and sera will be analyzed in PHE reference laboratories.
General practice clinical system providers have introduced an emergency new set of clinical codes to support COVID-19 surveillance.
Additionally, practices participating in current virology surveillance are now taking samples for COVID-19 surveillance from low-risk patients presenting with LRTIs.
Within the first 2 weeks of setup of this surveillance, we have identified 3 cases: 1 through the new coding system, the other 2 through the extended virology sampling.
We have rapidly converted the established national RCGP RSC influenza surveillance system into one that can test the effectiveness of the COVID-19 containment policy.
The extended surveillance has already seen the use of new codes with 3 cases reported.
Rapid sharing of this protocol should enable scientific critique and shared learning.
The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) is a network of general practices (GPs) with a nationally representative population that provides pseudonymized data for weekly surveillance of infectious diseases.
The disease surveillance program is commissioned by Public Health England (PHE) and covers 37 infectious diseases, including influenza.
The RCGP RSC and PHE have an established collaboration of over 50 years in influenza and respiratory disease surveillance and are now in their 53rd season of surveillance and analysis.
The RCGP RSC extracts pseudonymized data from a nationally representative sample of over 500 urban and nonurban GPs each week covering a population of over 4 million.
Data from these practices are reported online in a weekly return, which includes monitoring weekly rates of influenza-like illness (ILI) and other communicable and respiratory diseases in England.
We also produce an annual report.
The RCGP RSC data set includes all coded data and all prescribed items including vaccine exposure.
The RCGP RSC conducts virology surveillance each influenza season, with 100 GPs participating in the 2019-2020 season (Figure 1).
These virology sampling practices are also recruited to be nationally representative (Figure 1).
GPs take nasopharyngeal swabs from persons showing acute respiratory illness within 7 days of the onset of symptoms.
Nasopharyngeal swabs are taken from children younger than 5 years showing symptoms of acute bronchitis or bronchiolitis.
Additionally, nasopharyngeal samples are taken from anyone 5 years and older showing acute onset of ILI and respiratory synctial virus.
Swabs are tested at the PHE Respiratory Virus Unit for influenza to monitor positivity rates and circulating strains, as well as for measuring vaccine effectiveness.
The RCGP RSC successfully conducted a pilot collecting serological samples from adults and linking them to a patient’s medical records during the 2018-2019 influenza season.
This pilot was in collaboration with the PHE Seroepidemiology Unit and added to the residual blood samples submitted to PHE by National Health Service (NHS) laboratories.
Serology can provide important information about background population immunity, and sentinel networks can provide a mechanism for systematic data collection and linkage to medical records and health outcomes.
The serology pilot has demonstrated the ability of the network to collect serology samples in adults.
With the COVID-19 outbreak, PHE and RCGP RSC have adapted existing influenza surveillance to monitor the spread of COVID-19 in the community, and this protocol sets out the basis for that collaboration.
The primary national strategy for COVID-19 infection is containment, with patients who are at high risk managed via the telephone help system NHS111 and the PHE health protection teams, but the RCGP RSC surveillance is entirely separate.
The RCGP RSC, by extending its established work, will provide virological and serological surveillance to monitor the temporal and geographical distribution of COVID-19 infection in the community, and assess the effectiveness of the containment strategy.
We would not be working in isolation on this research.
We will share the protocol with UK colleagues and the I-MOVE consortium who have recently obtained EU Horizon 2020 funding from the stream “Advancing knowledge for the clinical and public health response to the novel coronavirus epidemic”.
It is anticipated that great efficiencies in project management will result through this collaboration than that obtained from countries acting alone.
The aim of this study is to identify whether there is undetected community transmission of COVID-19, estimate population susceptibility, and monitor the temporal and geographical distribution of COVID-19 infection in the community.
The objectives of this study are as follows:
To monitor the burden of suspected COVID-19 activity in the community through primary care surveillance and clinical coding of possible COVID-19 cases referred into the containment pathway
To provide virological evidence on the presence and extent of undetected community transmission of COVID-19 and monitor positivity rates among individuals presenting ILI or acute respiratory tract infections to primary care
To estimate baseline susceptibility to COVID-19 in the community and estimate both symptomatic and asymptomatic exposure rates in the population through seroprevalence monitoring
To pilot implementation of a scheme for collection of convalescent sera with antibody profiles among recovered cases of COVID-19 discharged to the community
We intend to capture the following.
Clinical workload related to reports of COVID-19 using the codes created to flag cases, those being assessed and where the infection is located are excluded (Figures 2-​-44)
Foreign countries visited in the last 28 days
Existing codes that may have utility (Tables 1-​-3).3).
Many GPs and primary care teams may not realize that important relevant data can be coded.
There is also the potential during any pandemic to monitor the effectiveness of any transmission control measures.
Reliable coding of letters and test results that will show an infection has become either confirmed or excluded
The methods will follow the approach used in the current influenza surveillance system and recent serology study, and includes five components: (1) primary care clinical surveillance; (2) virological surveillance; (3) population serological surveillance; (4) convalescent sera in cases; and (5) data curation.
The NHS uses the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) system of coding, which is normally only updated twice annually.
There was added complexity as some computerized medical record (CMR) suppliers use the Read coding systems (Read clinical terms version 3 – CTv3), which is no longer updated.
Additionally, there were no clinical codes to record COVID-19 in early February 2020.
Therefore, the two main GP system suppliers added the five terms shown in Table 4 as system-wide local codes.
A UK emergency release of SNOMED CT concepts for COVID-19 was also subsequently made available across all CMR systems (Table 4).
The intention is that these will eventually be mapped to the new SNOMED CT concepts as they become available, allowing recording of relevant data (Multimedia Appendix 1).
The key requirements for this release were the ability to code (Table 4) a case of COVID-19, exposure to risk of infection (travel to an area where there may be a higher risk), contact with anyone infected with COVID-19, a report that a person had been tested for COVID-19, and that the disease had been excluded (likely a negative test).
In addition, practices are now able to code any foreign travel undertaken, including the ability to record visits to multiple countries (implemented February 8, 2020).
Figures 2-​-44 show the EMIS web implementation.
Currently, virology samples for influenza surveillance are accompanied by a standard request form.
For COVID-19, we will create a new request form that will record:
Date of onset of symptoms
Diagnosis of any of the following:
Acute bronchitis/bronchiolitis in those younger than five years
Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI)
History of fever (Y/N); measured (Y/N); if yes, level
Shortness of breath (Y/N), if measured: oxygen saturation and respiratory rate
Recent travel (Y/N); if yes, countries visited in last 14 days
Contact with a named person with confirmed COVID-19 (Y/N) with a free text comment about the level of certainty
These codes will be grouped ontologically into “definite”, “probable”, “possible”, and “not a case” using our standard approach to grouping codes (Table 5), which has been used previously across disease areas.
The RCGP RSC definition for ILI is shown in Multimedia Appendix 2.
Public Presentation of Data Using an Observatory and Dashboards
We will develop an observatory to present data nationally and a dashboard for feedback to practices about their data quality and collection of virology and serology samples.
This is based on coding described in Table 4.
Definite case will be presented on our dashboard as “cases” of COVID-19.
Possible cases will be presented as “Under investigation” (investigating).
“Not a case” will be presented as “Excluded”.
Online data has been established within the initial few weeks in the COVID-19 Observatory (Figure 5), indicating the overall number of patients and rate per 10,000 patients of cases confirmed or under investigation, as well as where the virus is excluded.
We have the option to move to twice weekly surveillance reports with a scope to change this to daily reporting.
We will continue virology sampling from our sentinel practices, rather than discontinuing as seasonal influenza declines.
Additionally, we will recruit more surveillance practices.
The RCGP RSC virology practices will aim to undertake 200-300 nasopharyngeal swabs per week across the RCGP RSC sentinel network, collecting specimens across all age bands.
In addition to the inclusion criteria for influenza virology surveillance (ILI, acute bronchitis/bronchiolitis), participating practices will take nasopharyngeal swab samples from any people showing acute symptoms of LRTI if the onset of symptoms is within 7 days.
RCGP RSC research officers and practice liaison staff will manage practices to achieve a total national sample of 200-300 swabs per week.
This could be increased if PHE modelers require more samples.
Samples from each practice would be spread across the following age groups: &lt; 5 years, 5-17 years, 18-64 years, and 65 years and older
Samples (swabs or serum) collected will be sent via prepaid envelopes addressed to the appropriate PHE laboratory for analysis.
All samples collected will be tested for the presence of influenza and COVID-19.
Additionally, PHE will retrospectively test any influenza virology samples collected between early and mid-February 2020 for COVID-19.
Practices will still follow the PHE protocol for COVID-19 with respect to people at risk of infection who should be signposted down the containment pathway, rather than physically attend their practice.
Direct testing of those who attend surgery remains permitted, but we have also rolled out self-swabbing at home.
Summary of processes are detailed in Multimedia Appendix 3.
Everyone with an ILI or a respiratory illness who contacts a GP (eg, phones for an appointment) should be asked specifically about recent travel to China and other countries flagged in current PHE advice, or if they have had contact with other people with COVID-19.
If these screening enquiries are positive, the patient would be advised to not come to the practice but instead to follow the PHE flow sheet.
This can be by a reception or clinician staff, depending on individual practice protocol.
These calls should be coded into the GP CMR system and can be reported as part of the RCGP RSC weekly return.
We have developed training material to support this coding (Multimedia Appendix 4).
These include prompt cards for:
Practice reception or triage staff: for coding of any patients calling the practice with symptoms of acute respiratory infection with a history of travel to important areas based on PHE advice
Administrative staff or clinicians who code: to encourage consistent coding of results for any suspected cases, including coding of negative results for exclusion
Practices participating in virology surveillance will opportunistically collect blood samples from patients coming into the practice for a routine blood test.
Patients who attend their practice for a routine blood test will be asked to provide an additional sample for serology.
We have conducted initial searches within the RCGP RSC database to look at the number of full blood count (FBC) results and overall rates in adults and children (Figures 6-​-9).9).
An FBC is one of the most common tests performed, and we hope this will give an approximate indication of overall numbers of blood tests performed.
The sampling rate, per 100,000 patients was highest for children 15-17 years of age and 60 year or older in adults, with the lowest rates in children 0-4 years of age and 18-29 years of age in adults (Figures 6-​-99).
We will provide 1000 serology baseline samples across all ages that reflect the varying rates of attendance by age.
Additionally, we will test if we can obtain these all from virology practices to enhance the yield.
A good geographical spread is important, so PHE can advise on areas where serology will most usefully be collected.
This will be followed by 800 samples monthly.
The sample will be stratified with 200 specimens for prepandemic survey (100 for monthly) in the following age groups: &lt; 5 years, 5-17 years, 18-64 years, and 65 years or older.
The younger patients, in many practices younger than 14 years, and in nearly all for children younger than 8 years will require pediatric serology surveillance.
We will develop a new request form for practices to capture recent travel and exposure to COVID-19.
We will pilot a scheme for collecting convalescent serology from people with confirmed cases and who have had an acute virology sample at the time of their infection.
This is to identify a carrier state in patients who have recovered from the virus but may continue shedding the virus.
If there are a small number of cases, this may assist in developing a test kit for patients to take to their own GP and explore its acceptability to patients.
If there are a large number of COVID-19 cases nationally, convalescent samples could be collected from RCGP RSC practices where there are confirmed cases, with the ability to link to the full medical record.
This process may include checking pseudonymized NHS numbers for positive individuals at RCGP RSC practices, checking current PHE guidance regarding considerations of infectiousness for confirmed cases, and offering the patient an appointment following the previously mentioned process.
This needs to be carefully coordinated nationally across the network and may require PHE to ensure individuals are not contacted by multiple agencies.
RCGP RSC could provide a useful structure to channel the initial contact once PHE has made a request.
The RCGP RSC practices participating in the annual influenza virology surveillance have started sampling from patients showing symptoms of a LRTI.
All samples received are being tested for influenza and COVID-19.
The RCGP RSC will explore ways to collect convalescent samples from any patients tested positive for COVID-19 through the extension of the virological surveillance.
From the start, we will be carefully curating data to ensure that it can be used for future studies.
Our clinical data will be linked to virology.
We will curate our data using the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable principles.
To facilitate this our data set is listed with Health Data Research UK and the European Health Data Evidence Network.
The statistical methodology is in support of a policy approach to widespread disease outbreak, where so-called nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are used to respond to an emerging pandemic to produce disease suppression.
This policy aims to reduce contact rates in the population and thereby reduce transmission of the virus.
To implement this the UK government has recently articulated the desire to implement population self-isolation measures.
By targeting the reproduction number (R) (the average number of secondary cases each case generates) and aiming to reduce the R to below 1, the policy seeks to reduce case numbers to low levels or (as seen in previous outbreaks with severe acute respiratory syndrome and Ebola) to eliminate human-to-human transmission.
As the experience from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic has shown, NPIs can be a crucial component of pandemic mitigation.
Key to the focus of our study will be the estimation of peak cases in the population and continual monitoring by data collection and modelling the potential growth and emergence of subsequent peaks in new cases as social distancing measures are relaxed.
There has already been publication of important disease epidemiological measures concerning the outbreak of COVID-19 in mainland China.
A further fundamental measure in pandemic dynamics is the length of time from infection to when a person is infectious to others and the mean duration of infectiousness.
These factors, if estimated accurately, will give good predictions for the likely length of the pandemic, the final number of infected cases.
We intend to apply approximate Bayesian inference (ABC) to (possibly spatially heterogeneous) Susceptible-Exposed- Infectious-Removed (SEIR) stochastic epidemic models.
Such techniques are highly parallelizable and have been successfully applied to many fields including disease transmission modelling.
They are particularly suited to situations where likelihood functions are absent and where more traditional approaches such as Markov chain Monte Carlo are impractical.
Such an approach has been demonstrated to work effectively on the ASPREN surveillance data, a network of sentinel GPs and nurse practitioners who report deidentified information on ILIs and other conditions, where issues such as missing data and the need to model the observation process itself has been successfully addressed.
Furthermore, peaks in new cases have been estimated by distributional methods.
Estimates of the parameters of the SEIR model are tractable on large data sets because of parallelizability, and these methods have been implemented in several R libraries; we intend to use the libraries ABSEIR (deposited on GitHub: https://tinyurl.com/vqu35cj) and abctools (https://tinyurl.com/tfjavz4) to estimate epidemic measures on a weekly basis.
Since we are fitting an SIR-epidemic model in the ABC routine, we anticipate that our results will be robust against weekly case data containing relatively small counts.
For example, see for the ABC methodology applied to the Tristan da Cunha common cold data from 1967, where counts of I (number of infectious cases) and R (number of recovered cases) are in the tens at most.
Finally, in addition to the above methodology we will employ the Kaplan-Meier method with two outcomes (death and recovery) to estimate the case fatality ratio.
This approach is independent of the ABC methodology and will allow comparisons between estimates from the two modelling approaches to judge robustness of results.
RCGP RSC’s surveillance with PHE is defined as Health Protection under Regulation 3 of The Health Service (Control of Patient Information) Regulations 2002.
This has been confirmed by PHE’s Caldicott Guardian’s Office.
We do not see any increased risk to practices or practitioners taking part in this surveillance.
Infection prevention and control advice will follow extant national guidance.
Any cases identified will be managed according to the PHE/NHS guidance in force at the time, including advice for identified contacts.
However, our training will include reminders about safe handling of specimens and revision of infection control measures anticipated to be high in our practices.
It is a key part of Regulation 12 about safe care and treatment, periodically inspected by the Care Quality Commission.
Travel History and Clinical Descriptors of the COVID-19 Infections
The RCGP RSC practices have been advised on the clinical coding that has been made available for COVID-19 across all CMR systems.
This includes information on coding of clinical descriptors (Table 4) and any recent travel history.
Establishment of Extended Virology Sampling
The RCGP RSC practices participating in the annual influenza virology surveillance have started sampling from patients showing symptoms of LRTI.
All samples received are being tested for influenza and COVID-19.
This has led to initial early identification of background spread in low-risk patients.
As of March 7, 2020, the surveillance system has detected 2 cases of COVID-19 in low-risk patients with no history of travel through extended virological sampling.
This protocol describes how we have adapted a national influenza surveillance system to monitor community spread of an unexpected infection of COVID-19.
We have rapidly created and incorporated new codes to allow data recording, and are collecting data to monitor the effectiveness of containment strategies.
Through this surveillance, we intend to find out more about the epidemiology of COVID-19 in ambulatory care.
In particular, its rate of spread, both temporal and geographical.
Our testing of low-risk patients will also inform whether the containment strategy that is based on virology testing of high-risk patients and their contacts plus self-isolation is effective.
Containment should slow the spread, and there may be benefits in the management of spread from intense surveillance.
However, there may come a point at which the virus spreads more widely into the population, as has happened in Italy.
Surveillance of low-risk patients should inform when we reach this tipping point and when infection rates start to remit.
The epidemiology of COVID-19 remains emergent.
The registration-based nature of UK primary care means that we will be able to create a complete picture of the cumulative incidence and duration.
The surveillance system should be able to identify areas where COVID-19 spread is taking place that might be suitable for trials of antiviral therapy.
We could also follow up on the effectiveness or any adverse reactions to these medicines or vaccinations.
Finally, early detection of a confirmed COVID-19 case has exemplified the rapid implementation of this enhanced surveillance in the national network.
Safety of practices is our primary concern.
The RCGP RSC has operated for over 50 years and has been involved in collecting samples to monitor disease and vaccine effectiveness through the Hong Kong flu pandemic of 1968/69, the Russian flu of 1977/78, and the 2009 Swine flu pandemic.
We are not aware of any increased risk to practice staff or other patients from involvement in surveillance.
Pandemic preparedness is part of the role of the RCGP RSC.
It is plausible that enhanced coding of information from contacts with the practices in RCGP RSC will reduce the likelihood of people who may be suspected COVID-19 cases being brought to the surgery inadvertently.
Where cases are detected unexpectedly, it is probably helpful for that patient, their contacts, and the practice to know.
The impact on practices has been to close for a day, if a case is found, for deep cleaning and then reopen.
The principal limitations of our system are the number of data points.
We are collecting serology and virology data from 100 sites, which covers a small group of the population.
This has been satisfactory for monitoring influenza, but we are not certain if this is a sufficiently large sample for the COVID-19 outbreak.
Our sites (surveillance practices) are currently fixed, and it could be helpful to be able to rapidly onboard practices in regions where there are more cases.
Currently, we will be reporting weekly.
Our existing system can be enhanced to twice weekly, but maybe daily or hourly data should be our current approach.
Opportunistic sampling for serology in children younger than 10 years might be limited due to the overall reduced rate of blood tests in children.
The extended surveillance using the RCGP RSC-PHE network for the emergent COVID-19 outbreak has been established rapidly.
The model of getting the appropriate informatics to enable capture of the required data has already been a success, with data recording starting the week the codes were created.
In addition, modifying the existing surveillance system to collect population data in a parallel way has also been effective.
However, we are at present unsure as to whether the scale of this surveillance provides sufficient data to drive local containment strategies or if reporting infrequently meets the need of our information age.
Updating the diagnostic criteria of COVID-19 “suspected case” and “confirmed case” is necessary
On 6 February 2020, our team had published a rapid advice guideline for diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, and this guideline provided our experience and make well reference for fighting against this pandemic worldwide.
However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience; hence, the strategies of diagnosis and treatment are also continually updated.
In this letter, we answered one comment on our guideline and provided the newest diagnostic criteria of “suspected case” and “confirmed case” according to the latest Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh version) that issued by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused an outbreak, which is now officially named as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus has been named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to fight against the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a rapid advice guideline and that has been published online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
It has attracted a great attention since published.
Note however that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience; hence, the strategies of diagnosis and treatment are also continually updated.
For instance the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), among 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020, has issued a total of seven editions with some contexts being substantively changed.
Now our guideline received a comment by Zhou et al., they introduced a simple scoring proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work added new evidence for our guideline and also make valuable reference for this pandemic worldwide.
We endorse their significant work and express our thanks.
However, their work also needs update according to the latest Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (Trial seventh version) and recently studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the suspected case needs to combine any one item of epidemiological history features with two items of clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or needs to meet three items of clinical manifestations if without clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases had been reported in the last 14 days before symptom onset; (2) a history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contacting with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 had been reported in the last 14 days before symptom onset; (4) a history of contacting with cluster of confirmed cases (≥ 2 cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurred within 2 weeks in small areas, such as home, office, class of school, etc).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/ or respiratory symptoms; (2) with imaging features of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell counts showing normal, decreased, or reduced lymphocyte count in the early onset stage.
Diagnosing the confirmed case should base on suspected case with any one item of pathogenic or serological evidence as following: (1) real-time PCR test positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) viral whole genome sequencing showing high homogeneity to the known novel coronaviruses; (3) positive for the specific IgM antibody and IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 in serum test; or a change of the SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody from negative to positive, or titer rising ≥4 times in the recovery phase above that in the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in respiratory tract or blood samples was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
The pathogenic detection of blood sample was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These modifications based on the researchers continued work that to search for an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as the samples from respiratory tract including blood sampling, which increased the availability of different specimens, and supported bringing the specific antibody positive result into the confirmed criteria.
Besides, there are more and more evidence that remind us to caution with the atypical symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
Hence, the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they classified the person without clinical symptoms as “low risk”.
The score system also needs to be verified in further clinical practice and studies.
To conclude, we hope more direct evidence coming up and call for readers to provide their comments.
For the diagnosis of “suspected case” and “confirmed case”, we suggest to trace and obey the newest guidelines of their home countries.
Our team will also timely update our guideline to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, a daily highest
Yesterday, Bangladesh has confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 on the day.
This is the highest number of fatalities in a day due to the virus.
As of yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported the number of recorded infected cases included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases who were staying home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online news briefing, the director of IEDCR, Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the fatalities included four males and one female.
According to Dr Meerjady, two cases were aged above 60, two between 51 and 60, and one 41-50 years old.
She also said two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news outlet, that one of the deceased was Jalal Saifur Rahman, a director of Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was cared for at the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladeshi Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader said public transport would be shut down for longer than initially planned, until this coming Saturday.
This public transport shutdown had initially started on March 26 and was planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transport of essential goods -- medical, fuel and food -- was still allowed.
The first recorded incidents of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were on March 8, in two people who returned from Italy and also the wife of one of them.
As of March 19, these three had already recovered.
National Basketball Association suspends season due to COVID-19 concerns
On Wednesday, the United States' National Basketball Association (NBA) suspended its professional basketball season due to concerns regarding COVID-19.
The NBA's decision followed a Utah Jazz player testing positive for the COVID-19 virus.
The NBA did not release the identity of the player in question in its announcement.
They did say he was not present at Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City, where the Utah Jazz were to play against the Oklahoma City Thunder.
According to its press release, the NBA was "suspending game play following the conclusion of [Wednesday's] schedule of games until further notice."
The Jazz's game was cancelled, as was another NBA game Wednesday between the Sacramento Kings and the New Orleans Pelicans.
Other games scheduled for Wednesday were still held, according to NBC News.
The United States' other major basketball organization, the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which runs college basketball, has cancelled its own tournament, March Madness, for both men's and women's leagues.
According to Johns Hopkins University, as of Wednesday, there were at least 1,279 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States.
CNBC reported there were at least 118,381 cases worldwide.
SARS-CoV-2 surpasses one million infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections surpassed one million worldwide, Johns Hopkins University data indicated.
At least 52 thousand deaths were linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The milestone came the same day Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infections and Zambia had its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea claimed, as of Thursday, it was one of the few countries remaining free of coronavirus infections.
By yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty four hours preceding 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, over 244 thousand coronavirus cases were recorded, linking to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing Johns Hopkins University data, there were over 1,000 US deaths on Wednesday caused by coronavirus infections.
Around the world, countries announced stricter measures to inhibit the disease from spreading.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the city lockdown to May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin declared Russians would continue to be paid without going to work until April 30.
The parliament of Portugal voted to extend the national state of emergency by 15 days; the vote passed with 215 votes in favor, ten abstentions, and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended curfews in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to last the entire day; previously, the curfew was only in effect between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to implement a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
The governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced the state had extended its stay-at-home order until May 1.
Stores in Australia lower toilet paper limits per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles lowered their purchase restrictions on toilet paper to two and one package per transaction in all stores on national level, respectively.
ALDI also introduced a one-pack limit, on Monday.
These limitations were posted as messages on the checkouts, and on the chains' Facebook pages.
Buyers were reportedly stocking up due to fears of COVID-19 in case people need to self-isolate.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited toilet paper purchases for home delivery to one pack per order.
These changes followed the previous four-pack per transaction restriction introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5 respectively.
Coles, in its March 8 media release, reported that with the four-pack restriction in place, "many stores are still selling out within an hour of delivery", and called the demand "unprecedented", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unexpected".
Sales went up in a "sharp increase" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesperson.
Costco's store in Canberra also limited the allowed amount to two packs last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles ordered bigger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered extra stock, while ALDI made stocks for a planned Wednesday special available early.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that retailers try to raise stock, but local council restrictions on the timing of truck-deliveries make it hard.
He expects rising production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer specials.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that following the early release of stock, some stores can't run the Wednesday special.
In a News.com.au report, Dr Gary Mortimer, retail expert from Queensland University of Technology, said the stores fill the stock every night.
He remarked toilet paper is a bulky item, leading to low quantity of stocks in numbers, and, when sold out, leaves vast shelf spaces empty, hardening the feeling of a shortage.
Coles and Woolworths have a view [that] if there was plenty of stuff on the shelf, if product like toilet rolls and sanitiser could be [bought] and are there in quantities, you would probably minimise the panic said Russell Zimmerman per ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper producer Who Gives a Crap said on last Wednesday they'd run out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper which makes Sorbent, emphasized they were working 24/7 to maintain the supply, according to the News.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported some property sellers offering free toilet paper to the first bidder on auctions in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were held because of buyers having time off on the long weekend of Labour Day.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily printed in Darwin, included an eight-page insert meant to be cut up and used as toilet paper.
The stores were originally reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report from ABC Australia on March 3 in which they said they had no plans to introduce restrictions on the purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, sanitiser, dried goods, handwash and flour.
Similarly, outside of Australia, on Sunday evening online British supermarket Ocado was observed limiting purchases of Andres toilet paper to two 12-roll packs.
US President Trump declares COVID-19 national emergency
On Friday, United States President Donald Trump declared a national emergency in response to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.
The move came two days after the World Health Organization declared the outbreak, which causes the COVID-19 disease, to be a pandemic.
The move gives the federal government access to around US$50 billion in extra funding to combat the pandemic, according to NBC News.
The proclamation specifically said "the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States constitutes a national emergency" and said the national emergency began on March 1, almost two weeks before the proclamation itself.
The United States Department of Health and Human Services declared the outbreak a "public health emergency" on January 31.
Trump did not place the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in charge of the government's response to COVID-19, which Politico reported left some experts in disaster management disappointed.
Politico quoted Tim Manning, formerly a deputy administrator at FEMA, as saying "FEMA has an important role in coordinating the larger response to the crisis" and "[i]f there's an emergency, FEMA needs to be involved."
Trump made the decision under provisions of the National Emergencies Act, amongst other governing authorities.
The Trump administration also announced other efforts in response to COVID-19, including waiving the interest it collects on federal student loans and increasing U.S. strategic oil reserve oil purchases.
World Health Organization declares COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 — the disease caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 — to be a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" only refers to how widely a disease has spread, not how dangerous specific cases are, the WHO noted the need to drive governments to action:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, trace and mobilize their people in the response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of the WHO.
We are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity and by the alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, formerly the director of the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented."
He said, in remarks published by CNN in February, "other than influenza, no other respiratory virus has been tracked from emergence to continuous global spread."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying "we have never before seen a pandemic sparked by a coronavirus."
He continued, "and we have never before seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new status as a pandemic follows the WHO's decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
The United States' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease's director, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak, "bottom line, it's going to get worse."
As of Thursday, Associated Press reported there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in over 4,600 deaths.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020, and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The case fatality rate has been estimated to be 4% in China, while globally ranging from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy.
Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering one's mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, and monitoring and self-isolation for people who suspect they are infected.
Authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls, and facility closures.
The pandemic has led to severe global socioeconomic disruption, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages of supplies exacerbated by panic buying.
Schools and universities have closed either on a nationwide or local basis in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 percent of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of East and Southeast Asian descent and appearance, and others from areas with significant virus cases.
Due to reduced travel and closures of heavy industry, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
The cases mostly had links to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and so the virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV.
The earliest known person with symptoms was later discovered to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019, and that person did not have visible connections with the later wet market cluster.
Of the early cluster of cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to have a link with the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that a case traced back to 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old from Hubei province, may have been the first.
On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that, as new cases reportedly declined in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases within China for the first time.
There may be substantial underreporting of cases, particularly among those with milder symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among youths, with those 19 and under making up 2.4% of cases worldwide.
The United Kingdom's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the British population would need to become infected before effective herd immunity could be achieved.
Cases refers to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have had official policies not to test those with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that in China, up to 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these undocumented infections were the infection source for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published 30 March estimated that numbers of infections in Italy were considerably greater than the reported cases.
The initial estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention has concluded that it may be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not, the time from development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February about 80% of deaths were in those over 60, and 75% had pre-existing health conditions including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.Official tallies of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to dead people who tested positive for COVID according to official protocols.
The number of true fatalities from COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include people who die without testing - e.g. at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of excess deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death tally by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged "We know that [the stated death toll] is an underestimation", a statement corroborated by anecdotal reports of undercounting in the U.S. Such underestimation often occurs in pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic.The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on 14 February.
By 28 February, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths each were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, on every continent except Antarctica.
Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the volume of testing, healthcare system quality, treatment options, time since initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health.
The death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates for the death-to-case ratio decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptom onset 1–10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptom onset after 1 February 2020).
Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percent of diagnosed people who die from a disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percent of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not timebound and follow a specific population from infection through case resolution.
A number of academics have attempted to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the infection fatality rate for the pandemic as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper estimate of this range is consistent with the results from the first random testing for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analysing the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
The WHO asserts that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and ultimate duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may differ by location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University stated, "Left unchecked, infectious outbreaks typically plateau and then start to decline when the disease runs out of available hosts.
But it's almost impossible to make any sensible projection right now about when that will be".
The Chinese government's senior medical adviser Zhong Nanshan argued that "it could be over by June" if all countries can be mobilized to follow the WHO's advice on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "is going to be circulating, potentially for a year or two".
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be required "until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated, "I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus—because it's so readily transmissible—will disappear completely" and it "might turn into a seasonal disease, making a comeback every year".
The virulence of the comeback would depend on herd immunity and the extent of mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory sputum production (phlegm), loss of the sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea, or cyanosis.
The WHO states that approximately one person in six becomes seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms as difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.Further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of those infected may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms but with test results that confirm infection, so researchers have issued advice that those with close contact to confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and examined to rule out infection.
Chinese estimates of the asymptomatic ratio range from few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and symptom onset) ranges from one to 14 days; it is most commonly five days.
As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the fraction of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell was initially 30% and later fell to 15%.
Some details about how the disease is spread are still being determined.
The disease is believed to be primarily spread during close contact and by small droplets produced during coughing, sneezing, or talking; with close contact being within 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that an uncovered coughing can lead to droplets travelling up to 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
