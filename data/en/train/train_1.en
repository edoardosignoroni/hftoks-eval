Britain also helps India in the fight against Corona
More than 600 medical devices have been sent
India is currently experiencing the second wave of the Corona epidemic. 
India is fighting with all its might against the Corona.
 But with millions of coronaries increasing every day, the burden on the health system has grown enormously. 
In many places, hospitals are short of beds, oxygen, ventilators, remedicivir injections, vaccines, etc. 
As a result, patients are suffering.
 In such a situation, many countries around the world have come forward to help India. 
It is against this backdrop that Britain has also taken on the role of helping India in its fight against the Corona.
The UK today (Sunday) announced that it was sending more than 600 medical devices to India. 
These devices also include oxygen concentrators and ventilators. 
Britain has said the move is to help India in its fight against the Corona.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson has said, "We stand with India as a friend and as an ally in the fight against Corona. 
We will continue to work with the Government of India during this time of crisis. ”
The United States, France, Europe, Australia, China, Pakistan, Singapore and the UAE have so far announced policies to help India and have taken active initiatives. 
Corona is spreading rapidly in India and these countries are promising all possible help. 
Therefore, the tone is that India can get help in fighting the war against the Corona.
Health department proposes to import 25,000 metric tonnes of oxygen!
10 lakh for remediation, Rs 743 crore plan
The central government has warned that there are about 70,000 active corona patients in Maharashtra and the number could increase to 99,000 by the end of April.
In addition, 10 lakh Remedacivir injections will be procured. 
About Rs 743 crore 72 lakh will be spent for this.
Although the state produces 1,200 metric tonnes of oxygen, it currently consumes 1,550 metric tonnes of oxygen per day for corona patients and 400 metric tonnes of oxygen is procured from other states. 
However the number of corona patients is increasing rapidly in many states of the country. 
As this includes the states that supply oxygen to Maharashtra, it is likely that these states will not be able to supply oxygen in the near future, and in view of the growing number of patients, additional oxygen beds will have to be set up. Apart from importing oxygen, Pradeep Vyas plans to set up a new oxygen plant, arrange an oxygen concentrator next to the patient's bed and purchase a tanker for oxygen storage and transportation.
Apart from this, considering the shortage and need of remedicivir, an urgent proposal for purchase of 10 lakh remedicivir has been prepared and sent to the State High Authority Committee for approval. 
The proposal is worth Rs 743.72 crore and will be spent from the state disaster fund. 
The proposal, submitted by the health department on April 24, seeks permission to import 25,000 metric tonnes of oxygen at a rate of 500 metric tonnes per day at an estimated cost of Rs 100 crore.
Last week, Chief Secretary Sitaram Kunte had a meeting with Dr Pradeep Vyas, Principal Secretary, Health Department and others concerned regarding the import of oxygen. 
However, the decision was not taken as Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced that the Center would import oxygen from abroad. 
Two days ago, the Policy Commission and the Union Ministry of Health instructed the states to prepare for the review of the number of patients in various states of the country by the end of April 30 and how many beds, intensive care units and oxygen beds will be required. 
According to the information received from the central government, the state is expected to have 99,665 patients by the end of April 30, 16,061 oxygen beds will be reduced in the isolation ward, 2,877 beds in the intensive care unit and 1,450 ventilator beds. 
The state government can arrange the beds but the question of where the oxygen will come from was raised at a meeting of high-ranking officials. 
After that, Principal Secretary Dr. Pradeep Vyas has immediately prepared a proposal to import oxygen and set up an oxygen plant and purchase a tanker and submitted it to the State High Commission for approval.
According to the proposal, 132 Pressure Swing Adaptation Plants (PSAs) will be set up in 132 hospitals. 
The project is worth Rs 200 crore 80 lakh and will produce 600 to 3500 liters of oxygen per minute. 
The scheme will be implemented in 23 district hospitals, 8 general hospitals, 91 sub-district hospitals and 10 municipal hospitals of the health department. 
In addition, 40,701 oxygen concentrators will be procured for use in patient bedside. 
An oxygen concentrator produces a jumbo cylinder of oxygen in 24 hours, a senior health official said. 
The project will cost Rs 272.12 crore and 21 ISO tankers worth about Rs 40 lakh will be procured for Thane, Nashik, Pune, Kolhapur, Aurangabad, Latur and Nagpur. 
Considering the gap between the growing demand for remedicivir in the state and the supply from the center, 10 lakh remedicivir will be procured at a rate of Rs. 
As a result, there will no longer be a shortage of remedicivir for a month, health department sources said.

Out of 900 children registered under the flight, 20 have been coroned so far. However, due to timely treatment, they are now coronary free. If a diabetic child or their parent develops a cold, fever or any other symptoms, they should immediately contact a doctor and seek treatment at a hospital without getting sick, says Dr. Sarda.
The survey program for children with diabetes is not yet on the administration's agenda. When asked about that background, Deputy Director of Health Dr. Swapnil Lale said that no scheme for the survey of diabetic children is being implemented at the village level at present. However, information is sought about older people with diabetes. Prasad Mirkale, Deputy Chief Executive, Women and Child Welfare Department, Aurangabad Zilla Parishad, also said that the office was not instructed to seek information about children with diabetes.
Anxiety of adults more than children
Children with type 1 diabetes have not yet developed symptoms of mucorrhoea. However, they are in danger. As many as 20 diabetic children have died during the flight. Now they are cool. Type 2 diabetic patients in adults also have many other ailments and their families are worried about their health. With timely care of children, coronary heart disease can be completely cured. A proposal has been put before the health minister and officials to find out the number of children with diabetes and keep their statistics with the administration. Work has stopped due to Corona since last year.

Deaths of coroners due to inactivity of district administration
While the death toll in Vidarbha is declining everywhere, the death toll in the district is 'as it was', which is a matter of concern.
Letter of former MP from Chandrapur Naresh Puglia to the Chief Minister
 Demand for a high level inquiry
Chandrapur: Due to inactivity of Guardian Minister Vijay Vadettiwar and district administration, the highest number of 1,275 deaths of corona is in Nagpur division after Nagpur district. Lack of oxygen, lack of ventilator beds, shortage of medicines, shortage of doctors and medical staff, refusal to increase the salaries of doctors and staff despite having the right to appoint, result in twenty to thirty crore deaths every day. A high-level inquiry should be held into all these deaths. This is a very serious and frightening issue, so pay attention in time, otherwise the situation will get out of hand and the people will get angry, warned senior Congress leader and former MP Naresh Puglia to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and Pradesh Congress. A letter has been written to the chairman of the committee Nana Patole.
While the death toll in Vidarbha is declining everywhere, the death toll in the district is 'as it was', which is a matter of concern. Government hospitals, primary health centers lack health facilities. That is why the number of deaths is increasing. Puglia has demanded a high-level inquiry into the reasons behind the non-appointment of doctors and other medical personnel, even though the Mineral Development Fund is a huge amount of money and the district administration has the authority to spend 30 per cent of the expenditure from the district planning fund.
Zilla Parishad Chief Executive Officer Rahul Kardile has requested the officers and staff to appoint five MD doctors from one day's salary, pay them Rs one lakh, then why can't Guardian Minister Vijay Vadettiwar take the same decision.
The World Health Organization and the central and state governments have warned of a third wave. The district administration is expected to make proper planning for this. The affidavit has been given by the Collector, District Surgeon, Superintendent and Commissioner in the High Court. Puglia also said that doctors and medical staff should be paid more to serve them, provide medicines and other supplies to patients, and save patients' lives.
The Prime Minister will review the district on May 20. Considering the seriousness of this, the Chief Minister should pay attention to the problems of this district.

In the first wave of corona, the eruption of corona in Nagpur was delayed as compared to other parts of the state.
Since then, Corona's influence has gradually waned. 
What measures will the health department take to reduce these deaths?

Fighting at a wedding in Corona
The number of people injured in the clashes has not been released yet.
Vasai: It has come to light that two groups clashed while dancing in a turmeric ceremony at Sakwar Patilpada in Vasai East. Despite the government's ban on wedding ceremonies during the Coronation period, large crowds of citizens have been surprised.
The wedding of Sunil Tumbada of Tumbada family was held on Sunday 16th May at Patilpada of Sakwar village in Vasai East. The wedding ceremony was preceded by a yellow ceremony the day before. This turmeric event was crowded with hundreds of visiting congregations. While the citizens present in Haldi were dancing at this time, some of these dancers were in a state of intoxication. After midnight, there was an argument between the dancers. This argument turned into a fight. Many were running after each other, while others were beating each other. Some threw chairs at each other.
The number of people injured in the clashes is yet to be ascertained. The kind of video that is currently being beaten is spreading everywhere.
As per the rules of the government, the wedding has been attended by 25 people and a time of two hours has been fixed. But this incident has shown that the government's restrictive rules have been literally trampled on. The question is how such a large number of citizens attended when only a few people were allowed. A case has been registered at Virar police station, Virar police said.
A case has been registered at Virar police station for violating Karona rules. Also, nine people involved in the case have been arrested so far. - Suresh Varade, Senior Inspector of Police, Virar Police, Thane
"It's a pleasure to have a vaccine project anywhere"; Ajit Pawar pierces BJP MLA's ear
High Court orders allotment of land in Pune to Bharat Biotech
While the Corona crisis is raging in the country and the state, there is a rift between the ruling party and the opposition in the state. Now that Bharat Biotech has chosen a site in Pune for vaccine production, allegations are rife. BJP MLA Krishna Khopade has alleged that Bharat Biotech project was hijacked in Pune. Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar has given a blunt answer and refuted the allegations.
"The Mumbai High Court has ordered the allotment of land at Manjari in Haveli taluka of Pune to Bharat Biotech for a corona vaccine project. As the Guardian Minister of Pune District, I have fulfilled my responsibility to ensure that the orders of the High Court are complied with. I would have been happy if Bharat Biotech's vaccine manufacturing project had taken place anywhere in the state including Pune and Nagpur. Therefore, the allegation of BJP MLA Krishna Khopade that 'Bharat Biotech project was hijacked by Ajit Pawar in Pune' is totally false, misleading to the people, an apologetic attempt to create a political sensation for the publicity of Aut Ghatke, 'replied Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar.
Bharat Biotech Vaccine Manufacturer had demanded a site for a vaccine plant in Pune. For this, Bharat Biotech has set up the closed Intervet India Pvt. Ltd. at Manjari. The company had proposed to the state government to get the land. Bharat Biotech moved the High Court seeking an immediate decision on the proposal. The High Court, in view of the crisis in Corona and the need for vaccine production, has directed to start Bharat Biotech project at Manjari in Haveli taluka of Pune, he added.
"The whole of Maharashtra is fighting in unity against Corona. The whole of Maharashtra is one from Chandya to Bandya and the Mahavikas Aghadi government is committed to the industrial, economic and infrastructural development of every district and division of the state. The Deputy Chief Minister has appealed to the opposition to stop trying to mislead the people by making false, factless allegations.
After Mumbai and Pune, now Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation will also purchase vaccines directly!
Vaccination in the area has been suspended today due to shortage of vaccines.
Considering the shortage of vaccines in Pimpri Chinchwad, Pimpri Chinchwad Mayor Usha Dhore informed that they are planning to issue a global tender for at least 15 lakh units of vaccines. The Indian Express has published the news about this.
Vaccination in Pimpri Chinchwad area has been stopped today due to shortage of vaccines. The health department has appealed to people not to rush for vaccinations as the vaccination center is closed. The state health department will supply the vaccines to the municipal corporation by noon. Officials have said that the vaccination schedule for Tuesday will be announced only after the stock of vaccines is available.
The mayor said that discussions were also held with Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar regarding the purchase of vaccines directly through this global tender. She said that the Deputy Chief Minister himself said that if the municipal administration wants to buy vaccines directly, it does not need the permission of the state government.
Mayor Usha Dhore also said that once adequate stocks of vaccines became available, the entire city could be vaccinated. Currently, vaccinations have to be stopped in some places due to lack of vaccines. Citizens are crowding outside the vaccination center every day and forming large queues. This can increase the risk of corona proliferation. So we are planning to buy vaccines and stock up on enough vaccines. So that vaccination can be completed by avoiding congestion.
After Mumbai and Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation will be the third corporation to purchase vaccines directly, she said.

Discrimination in remedicivir injection delivery
These injections have sold for between Rs 50,000 and Rs 50,000.
422 injections to a 9-bed hospital and 260 injections to a 69-bed hospital
Chandrapur: Disaster Management Minister and Guardian Minister Vijay Vadettiwar's official Twitter account has revealed that there has been a huge discrimination in the distribution of Remedesivir injections given to critically ill patients in the district. Kirti Medical at Dr. Vishwas Zade's Spandan Heart Hospital, which has nine oxygen beds, received 422 injections of remedesivir, while 69 beds received only 260 injections. This discrimination is obvious and Dr. Zade was the Congress candidate from Ballarpur assembly constituency. It is now being shouted that this is his reward.
The black market of remedesivir injection has been going on in the district since the very first day. 
Also, a list has been given to 31 drug stores in the district. 
In Guardian Minister Vijay Vadettiwar's Bramhapuri Assembly constituency, 62 injections were given to Sparsh Medical Hospital at Khobragade Hospital with 25 beds and 260 injections to Christ Hospital with 48 beds at Astha Hospital with 40 beds. Meanwhile now Dr. The question arises as to why such a large number of remedesivirs were made available in the hospital when there was a shortage of oxygen beds.
What is special is that in the assembly elections, Dr. Zade was the Congress candidate against former minister MLA Sudhir Mungantiwar in the Ballarpur assembly constituency. There is a discussion as to whether they have benefited from the distribution of Remedesivir.
There is no discrimination in distribution
When CK Dange, an official of the Food and Drug Administration, was asked about this, he said that there was no problem in the Remedesivir injection delivery system. He also said that this did not happen in the district where Remedesivir was distributed.

The growing number of patients in Nagar taluka is dangerous for the city
Nagar: As some restrictions imposed in the city due to the rising corona outbreak were relaxed from today, Saturday, some markets and streets were crowded in the morning. Many citizens were found to be violating the ban on double-seating on two-wheelers without the use of masks. Vendors had spread beds on the streets, especially vegetable vendors.
It is noteworthy that the number of coronet sufferers has increased from many villages in Nagar taluka. Today, the highest number of daily infections in the district is found in Nagar taluka. The number of patients is more in Nagar taluka than in Nagar city. The day to day affairs of many villages in the taluka also depend on the city. A large number of citizens from Nagar taluka come to Nagar for daily business. The city is in danger of increasing the number of coroners from Nagar taluka to villages.
From the end of April to the first week of May, the daily average number of patients in the city had increased from 700 to 800. Against this backdrop, Municipal Commissioner Shankar Gore visited the city on. Strict restrictions were imposed between May 2 and 10. Grocery stores and vegetable sales were also closed. Only medical services were started. The number of patients in the city has been declining since last week due to the closure of private establishments. An average of 250 to 300 are found daily. The number of patients has stabilized around 250 in the last few days. No further decline is seen.

Relatives of patients in Satara, Shirkhurma to health workers
The Muslim Brotherhood celebrated Ramadan Eid by distributing Shirkhurma to the relatives, doctors and health workers of the patients at the 'Jumbo Kovid Center' area in Satara.
Ramadan Eid celebration by Muslim brothers
Y: The Muslim Brotherhood celebrated Ramadan Eid by distributing Shirkhurma to the relatives, doctors and health workers of the patients at the Jumbo Covid Center area in Satara.
Eid means uniting all communities and serving them. 
Today being Ramadan Eid, there is an atmosphere of great excitement everywhere. 
The youths and elders of the Muslim community in Satara had decided to celebrate Eid by distributing Shirkhurma to the relatives of the patients staying at the Satara Jumbo Hospital and other hospital premises to the doctors, nurses and health workers. 
At the treatment center in the air
Many corona care centers in rural areas of the district have been converted into corona treatment centers (DCHCs). 
Problems due to unavailability of medical officers, trained staff
Palghar: Many Corona Care Centers in rural areas of the district have been converted into Corona Treatment Centers (DCHCs). But due to non-availability of medical officers and trained staff in this center, patients are suffering. Relatives of the patients are also facing difficulties.
A corona health center with 50 oxygen beds has been set up in the health team building near Palghar Rural Hospital. Apart from this, the capacity of Corona Health Centers was also increased in Vangaon, Mokhada, Wada and Dahanu talukas. But there are not enough medical officers and nurses to treat the patients here as well as class IV staff to take care of them.
Due to the shortage of medical officers, trainee doctors or seasoned doctors are entrusted with the responsibility of the patient ward. But they have problems with treatment of corona patients, lack of skills on how to handle critically ill patients. Therefore, if a patient has low oxygen levels, it is time for the ward authorities to call the relatives of such patients to the treatment center and urge them to relocate the critically ill patient to the intensive care unit. At present, it is difficult to get a bed in the intensive care unit of a government or private hospital, which makes the relatives of the patient panic.
There is not even enough Class IV staff or help available to help patients go to breakfast or have a meal while undergoing oxygen therapy. Therefore, the critical patient has to do these tasks himself. In many of these cases, the patient is reported to have had serious complications due to lack of oxygen.
There is a shortage of manpower for cleaning toilets and rooms, changing the sheets on patients' beds or similar tasks. This raises the issue of health in Corona treatment centers and dedicated Corona hospitals.
Although oxygen beds have been made available, flowmeters and other technical equipment required to measure oxygen levels are not readily available, leading to technical difficulties in treatment. Although some centers are recruiting manpower on a seasonal basis, the lack of training has affected the mood and many employees have left. Therefore, some newly recruited medical officers, nurses, class IV staff and helpers need to be trained and counseled by psychiatrists, said the head of some treatment centers.
If the district administration acquires expert medical teams from various places in the district and asks them to provide services in corona centers, it will be more convenient to treat critically ill patients, the heads of some corona centers in the district told Loksatta.
Liquid diet for critically ill patients
Critically ill patients are being oxygenated and such patients have to have their oxygen system removed while going for lunch or breakfast. They have to bear the brunt of it. Similarly, the same type of meal is served in the hospital. But it is not always fruitful for all patients. Medical caregivers have suggested that it would be easier to care for critically ill patients if they were given a liquid diet instead of the usual meals given to critically ill and critically ill patients. Critical patients are being treated in the same manner in private hospitals and the government corona treatment center needs to follow suit.
Dissatisfied with the salary
In the Mumbai-Thane Municipal Corporation area, government and private hospitals are heavily paid to the medical staff and due to the limited funds available in the district, the officers and staff of the government corona hospitals in the district are not willing to work for a relatively low salary. As a result, there is a huge shortage of manpower in the district.
The need for a help center
Relatives of the patients are demanding that the Corona Treatment Center and the dedicated Corona Hospital should set up an out-of-hospital help and information center to provide information on the current status and progress of patients admitted to government hospitals.

The need for a crematorium in the cemetery
In Palghar Municipal Council area, there is a demand for installation of gas crematorium in the crematorium where coronary patients are cremated.
Smoke pollution in the area; The condition of all five iron right
Palghar: In Palghar Municipal Council area, there is a demand to install gas crematorium in the crematorium where coronary patients are cremated. It has been said for the last several months that a large quantity of firewood has been required for cremation of infected corpses here.
As there is a corona treatment center in Palghar Municipal Council area, the patients who die at that place are cremated in the cemetery east of Palghar. More than 100 bodies have been cremated in the cemetery since last month. It takes about 500 kg of wood and at least five liters of kerosene to bury a dead person. Thousands of kilos of wood and kerosene have been used on hundreds of such deaths so far.
This cemetery is open 24 hours a day. As a result, the smoke from here is spreading in the area and endangering the environment and the citizens of the area. At the same time, as all the five iron rights in the cemetery have been found in a bad condition, there is a demand to consider gas right while installing new ones. This will also reduce the cost and also reduce the emission of smoke as it is environmentally friendly and will not cause any environmental degradation. Therefore, there is a demand to install gas right.
It is proposed to supply gas through pipeline to households in Palghar Municipal Council area. This work has been approved. Therefore, since the pipeline will pass through different parts, it is possible to take the gas pipeline to the cemetery and make a gas burn there.
During the Corona period, smoke from funerals poses a threat to the environment. If gas right is used, it will avoid danger and will also save fuel. There is a demand to install gas right from Vasundhara Abhiyan.

Sachin Sawant said that the ventilators provided to the Ghati Hospital in Aurangabad were closed and even the technicians could not repair them. "A committee of medical experts appointed by the Government Medical College, Aurangabad has found that these ventilators are completely useless. According to his report, even company technicians could not fix it. This is a big scam and all the ventilators supplied to Maharashtra by the Center should be investigated at the state level, ”said Sachin Sawant.
Game with the soul of the people
"A similar scam has come to light in the ventilators given to Nashik. The BJP had made a big fuss over the provision of ventilators by the central government. But as many as 60 ventilators were in partial condition. Installation stopped due to lack of spare parts. Also, out of 35 ventilators sent from PM Care Fund in June, some ventilators are still out of order and due to non-receipt of spare parts from the concerned company, these ventilators are lying unused. The Modi government has played this game with the lives of the people, ”said Sawant.
Janata Rambharosech!
Speaking on the occasion, Sachin Sawant said, “It is unforgivable that public money is wasted through PM Care Fund. The Modi government forced all the corporates in the country to donate to this opaque fund. No information was provided about the fund or the right to information was enforced. But now the public must understand how and why such highly competitive companies got these contracts. Leave scandal in this biggest crisis for humanity but it is also inhumane to think of profit. Due to the arbitrariness of the Modi government, thousands of people lost their lives in the Corona epidemic due to lack of oxygen and ventilators. But the Modi government does not seem to have learned anything from that. The overall picture is that the people of the country have been released, ”said Sawant.
The 72-year-old received the first dose of covacin and the second dose of covishield; Shocking type in Rajesh Tope's district
Revealed when side effects appeared after taking the second vaccine
On the one hand, there is a shortage of corona vaccines in the country, while on the other hand, there is a big irresponsibility in Maharashtra regarding vaccination. In Maharashtra's Health Minister Rajesh Tope's Jalna district, an elderly man has been given two different doses of vaccine. This person was given the first dose of covacin. The second dose is Covishield vaccine. It is learned that after the second dose, the person was informed by his relatives that he was suffering. Doctors are monitoring the health of this person.
Dattatraya Waghmare, 72, of Khandvi village in Jalna, was given a dose of covacin on March 22 at a rural hospital in Partur. He was then called on April 30 for a second dose of the vaccine. When Dattatraya went for the second dose, he was given a dose of the covishield vaccine available at the health center in Shrishti village.
According to Waghmare's son Dingbar, Dattatraya had developed a fever and dry skin after taking the second dose. After experiencing the side effects of the vaccine, Dattatraya was taken by Dingbar to a health center in Partur. There they were given some medicine. The next day, Dattatraya was given two different doses of the vaccine.
After documents and information provided by the family, a team of doctors reached Dattatraya's house to examine him. Doctors were informed that Dattatraya had undergone heart surgery a few years back. The boy said that Dattatraya had undergone bypass surgery. My parents are uneducated. That is why they were not informed about the dose of the vaccine. This is due to the irresponsibility of the officials at the vaccination center. Digambar has said that the second vaccine was given by the medical staff without checking which vaccine was given earlier. An inquiry has been ordered into the matter, said Swapnil Lale, deputy director of health, Aurangabad division.
Vidarbha has the highest number of private hospitals treating corona patients
The first Corona patient was registered and completed the year on 10th May
Shalinitai Meghe Super Specialty Hospital in Sawangi, which has become known as the largest private hospital treating corona patients in Vidarbha, had the first corona victim as well as the first corona-free patient. It completed its year on May 10. Since then, as the year draws to a close, a team of working doctors and other medical personnel has been ready to face a possible third wave, and this tireless service has been a boon for the health sector.
The corona report of the woman who died on May 8, 2020, was received as obstruction. 
The entire 365 days and beyond the responsibility of the team. Shaurya Acharya, Dr. Sunil Kumar, Dr. Shilpa Bavankule, Dr. Vivek Chakole, Dr. Tushar Sontakke, Dr. The names of Swapnil Lahole are given priority. 
Initially the number of beds was low due to the low number of patients.
Guidance regulations were issued by the government ten times during the year. 
Others have given full-time service to their families, leaving their children in the care of their families. 
It is pointed out that the hospital, which handles such a large number of patients, does not have its own oxygen project on the eve of the Corona Hospital. 
 The government has demanded a small project and it will be implemented soon. 
Vice Chancellor Dr. Meghe Abhimat, who is in charge of the hospital system under the University. "Overcoming the shortcomings, we have successfully overcome the challenge of corona despite being in rural areas," said Rajiv Borle. The state government gave us testimonials as the best corona care center. Only 92 died in the first wave and 386 in the second wave. Despite handling the highest number of patients in Vidarbha, no one blamed our hospital for negligence. Co-ordinating with the administration is determined to continue to challenge Corona.
Vaccination is scarce in rural areas
Attempts fail; Misunderstandings, rumors
Palghar: While vaccination centers are crowded in urban areas, there is very little response to vaccination in rural areas of the district. Despite the efforts of the administration and the people's representatives, they are not getting the expected response. A special public awareness campaign has been launched in the dialect to motivate the villagers for vaccination. However, rumors and misinformation on social media are hitting vaccinations in rural areas.
More than two lakh 90 thousand have been vaccinated in Palghar district. About 1.5 lakh villagers in Vasai taluka, more than 82,000 in Palghar and less than 4,000 in Mokhada and Talasari talukas have been vaccinated. These talukas have a higher number of vaccinated health and frontline staff. At the same time in Vikramgad, Jawahar, Wada and Dahanu talukas the rate of vaccination is very low compared to the population.
Ignorance, misunderstandings and rumors circulating on social media in rural areas, especially among tribal villagers, seem to be hindering vaccination. MLAs in the district have tried to dispel their misconceptions. MLAs Sunil Bhusara, Srinivas Vanaga and Rajesh Patil took the first dose of vaccination. They are trying to encourage villagers to participate in the vaccination campaign through their activists. Dahanu MLA Vinod Nikole himself has not yet been vaccinated and said he would get vaccinated soon.
MLA absent from camp inauguration
MLA Vinod Nikole was invited to attend the inauguration of the vaccination camp held at Talasari Amgaon. However, the MLAs avoided attending the inauguration function. Zilla Parishad member Anil Zirwa launched the campaign by vaccinating himself. As MLA Vinod Nikle has not yet been vaccinated, it has become a topic of discussion in the constituency.
A special public awareness campaign has been launched in the dialect to provide information about Corona disease as well as vaccinations and to dispel misconceptions. Audio-video has been prepared to inform about the disease and it is being disseminated in the villages.
MLA Sunil Bhusara conducted an awareness campaign in his constituency about vaccination through loudspeakers as per the election campaign system. MLA Rajesh Patil organized vaccination camps in some places as well as seminars for private medical professionals. MLA Vinod Nikole campaigned for his party workers to get vaccinated themselves, while MLA Srinivas Vanaga campaigned to convince his own brothers about the importance of vaccination.
* There are 21 centers in Palghar for vaccination of citizens above 45 years of age. There are 13 centers in Dahanu, eight in Jawahar, five each in Mokhada, Talasari and Wada talukas, four in Vikramgad and 31 in Vasai taluka. A total of 15 vaccination centers have been set up for citizens in the age group of 18 to 44 years in rural areas and three in Vasai-Virar Municipal Corporation.

Symptoms of MISC disease in infants with antibodies
With proper diagnosis and timely treatment, the disease can be cured early, but if delayed, the patient's health is at risk.
Yavatmal: Pediatrician and IMA President Dr. Yavatmal has observed that the symptoms of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome Post Covid (MISC) are prevalent in children with coronary heart disease as well as children who have developed antibodies to covid. Reported by Sanjeev Joshi. Six children with the disease have so far been found to be admitted to the hospital after the first Kovid Hospital for Children was started in Vidarbha.
With proper diagnosis and timely treatment, the disease can be cured early, but if delayed, the patient's health is at risk. The second wave of corona has a significant number of young people affected more than the elderly. So now, according to various medical reports, including government agencies at the national level, the third wave of corona is said to put children at greater risk. In this connection, while the government is planning for the treatment of children, there is concern over the discovery of children with symptoms of 'MISC-Post Covid' disease in Yavatmal.
After recovering from the corona infection, the children were found to have swelling on various organs of the body and to have adverse effects on the heart including limbs, eyes and eyes. Symptoms include swelling of the heart and formation of blood clots in the heart and body. After the mother of the child became infected with coronavirus, the disease was found to be exacerbated in children who did not have any symptoms of coronavirus but developed covid antibodies in the body. Sanjeev Joshi told Loksatta. It is found to affect children between the ages of 5 to 15 years. The symptoms of MISC-post covid are similar to those of Kawasaki disease, which is more common in children, he said.
Children in Europe and Britain had symptoms of the disease during the first wave of coronavirus.
The number of corona patients is high and the number of pediatric patients with MISC-post covid symptoms is also significant. Joshi said.
Adornment of untiring service
The corona report of the woman who died on May 8, 2020 was interrupted.
Admirable work of Shalinitai Meghe Super Specialty Hospital
Wardha: The Shalinitai Meghe Super Specialty Hospital in Sawangi, which has become known as the private hospital handling the largest number of corona patients in Vidarbha, had registered the first corona victim and the first corona-free patient. It completed its year on May 10. Since then, as the year draws to a close, a team of working doctors and other medical personnel is gearing up for a possible third wave, and this season of tireless service has been a boon for the health sector.
The corona report of the woman who died on May 8, 2020 was interrupted. 
There are others who help them. 
Remadecivir, now in its infancy, was not even included in the treatment until August 2020. 
A total of ten members of his family, including Vijay Babhulkar, working as a scientific officer in a government laboratory, were admitted here as patients. 
The hospital, which handles such a large number of patients on the eve of the year of corona patient service, is pointed out that it does not have its own oxygen project. The administration had to rush for oxygen as the supply was cut off a month ago. Speaking on the occasion, administrative officer Dr. Uday Meghe said that it was only after the increase in the number of patients that he realized the need to have his own oxygen project. But now a Rs 2 crore oxygen project is proposed and it will be operational in some time. The government has demanded a small project and it will be implemented soon.
The Vice Chancellor of Meghe Abhimat University, Dr. Rajiv Borle said, “Overcoming the shortcomings, we have successfully overcome the challenge of corona even in rural areas. The state government gave us testimonials as the best corona care center. Only 92 died in the first wave and 386 in the second wave. Despite handling the highest number of patients in Vidarbha, no one blamed our hospital for negligence. Corona is determined to continue to challenge the administration.

'Forget the factions and fight at the village level for emancipation'
Today, interaction was held with Sarpanch and village officials of Nagar, Nevasa, Shrirampur, Rahuri, Akole and Sangamner talukas.
District Collector's interaction with the Sarpanch of the district

Hivrebazar Karonamukti fight

Lockdown hits textile industry again
There are 20 lakh looms in the decentralized sector in the country, out of which 50 per cent or more than one million looms are in Maharashtra.
Signs of dying machine spinning business
Sangli: The textile industry in the state is in trouble due to the Corona crisis, but the government's revenue has also sunk. While recovering from last year's crisis, the Corona crisis is showing signs of dying. The layoffs have hit three lakh people directly and one lakh indirectly in the textile industry.
Corona virus infections have paralyzed the entire world for the past year. 
However, considering the 10 lakh looms at Vita, Malegaon, Bhiwandi, Ichalkaranji and Sangli, 90 per cent of the looms are closed as 10 to 15 per cent of the factories do not have accommodation for the workers.
There are 20 lakh looms in the decentralized sector in the country, out of which 50 per cent or more than one million looms are in Maharashtra. Due to the 21-day lockout in the first phase, considering the average productivity of the spinning department, about 170 crore meters of cloth could not be produced. Its value was more than five thousand crore rupees. Of course, textile production worth Rs 5,000 crore has sunk. From the decentralized sector, the employment of three lakh direct and one lakh indirect workers depends on machinery alone. In these 21 days, their employment has gone down by about Rs. As textile production worth Rs 5,000 crore has sunk, the Center and the state governments have to release water directly on the GST revenue of Rs 250 crore at five per cent. MSEDCL, on the other hand, has to pay Rs 150 crore for the sale of 50 crore units of loom power in these 21 days.
Thus, the loss figures for the first 21 days of the loom department in the state's textile chain alone are so huge and alarming. Considering the entire textile chain together, this loss is going to be huge. Moreover, the longer the lockout period, the greater the losses. It is unknown at this time what he will do after leaving the post.
On the other hand, the fall in yarn and textile prices due to the shutdown will directly cost the spinners crores of rupees. This has become a matter of great concern. Yet in this terrible crisis of the country, all the spinning small scale entrepreneurs in the state have taken the role of cooperating with the government and the administration.
After coming out of this terrible crisis, however, only if a special assistance scheme is announced for this small scale industry, which is already in trouble, will this industry come to its former position. Due to the layoffs, the textile industry, which has the highest employability, needs to be given a boost in the future along with concessions. Otherwise, the well-known business is on the verge of extinction. - Kiran Tarlekar, President Vita Yantramag Sahakari Sangh.
No need for 'e-registration' for vaccination - Prithviraj Chavan
The online process for 18- to 44-year-olds should not be mandatory, so that the current hustle and bustle outside the vaccination center does not happen.
Karad: The e-registration process of vaccination is causing confusion. Former Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan suggested that proper rules should be made for vaccination, drawing attention to the fact that the number of people in the district is also coming to Satara district as the number of the registrant is coming to any center. MLA Chavan called a meeting of the administration in Karad on the backdrop of increasing crowds for vaccination after positive awareness among the people about corona vaccination. The administration was present along with Prantadhikari Uttam Dighe and Tehsildar Amardeep Wakde.
Chavan said preference should be given to those with a second dose in vaccination. Also, the online process for 18- to 44-year-olds should not be mandatory, so that the current hustle and bustle outside the vaccination center does not happen. Also, every primary health center, sub-district hospital, rural hospital should be made public on a daily basis about the dose of vaccine. This will provide information to the people about vaccination and the administration will be able to control the crowd and the vaccination process will be carried out smoothly with proper planning.

The No Mask, No Entry campaign was implemented in the district, it has been successful and this campaign will be started again. Citizens in rural areas have covid-like symptoms, the collector said. Therefore, citizens should come forward and get their health checked. The health department should complete the ILI and SARI survey from door to door. If the person's report in the survey is positive, it should be submitted to Covid Care Center. On May 20, the Prime Minister will review the district's health facilities. Therefore, during the presentation, daily information of discharged patients, daily infected patients, deaths, active patients, RTPCR as well as antigen testing, ILI and all patients should be kept up to date, he said.
He also reviewed the issue of vaccination. Vaccination against coronavirus is a treatment and vaccination in urban and rural areas should be done properly. Appropriate distribution should be done within the district after vaccination. He also said that there should be public awareness in areas where there is no response to vaccination. At this time, he gave instructions to know the current situation in all the talukas and take necessary measures.
Lockdown has been increased but how will the working people live, what will the government do for them? - Everybody
Will this government ignore the demands of the top leaders of the alliance Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi? That is also the question.
The government has decided to extend the lockdown in Maharashtra till June 1. But before extending the lockdown, the BJP had repeatedly said that it should understand the plight of small businesses and hard workers and provide them with financial assistance, but the government announced the lockdown without considering it. The package announced by the government in the previous lockdown has not yet reached all the beneficiaries. While the BJP has been demanding help for the working class during the lockdown, now the leaders of the constituent parties in the Mahavikas Aghadi government, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, have also made the same demand to the Prime Minister. Won't the government understand the sentiments of the top leaders of the Ghatak party? Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Council Pravin Darekar has asked this question to the government.
Darekar was speaking to the media after the state government decided to increase the lockdown. The decision to extend the lockdown without any planning has put the working class in even more trouble, what will the government do for them? This question has also been raised by Pravin Darekar.
"Mahavikas Aghadi government is responsible for the day-to-day postponement of
vaccinations" In fact, it was the responsibility of the state government to get these vaccines, but the Mahavikasaghadi government is running away from its responsibility and is doing such tricks. Until now, the vaccine had to be obtained by the state government. But still the government is just playing the game of correspondence. Where did the check kept by the government get stuck? Other states have booked vaccines, registered, paid and the Maharashtra government is still stuck in sending letters to the Center. Vaccination in the state is going on day by day and the Mahavikas Aghadi government is responsible for it, ”alleged Darekar.
"The Thackeray government is spending crores
to hide the real situation of Corona and to enhance its image" - "The Thackeray government is spending billions to hide the real situation of Corona and to promote its image by painting a false picture in front of the public. Therefore, by questioning what exactly the Thackeray government's PR agency is doing, this should be investigated at the senior level, ”Darekar has also demanded.
Also, the government is pretending to prevent the spread of corona through the media and advertisements, and a false image is being painted in front of the public to praise itself. But in today’s situation it is unnecessary. In the tribal areas, Dhule, Nandurbar, Palghar and Gadchiroli do not get response for treatment. While there is a need to spend on awareness and advertisements, the government is spending the hard earned money of the people for its own publicity.
"Global tendarababata government scam" -
"The government has said that global tenders, is going to write a letter to ask for permission to remove the central government. But on the one hand, the government has been saying that it has been processing the global tender since last week. Mumbai Municipal Corporation has even announced so. Is the alliance government seeking permission from the Center for the global tender and at the same time the municipal corporation is getting approval? Godbengal doesn't know anything about this, ”said Darekar.
"Government's reckless management
of vaccination revealed" - "The Central Government will vaccinate the citizens above 45 years of age and the State Government wants to vaccinate the citizens between the ages of 18 to 45 years." For this, the central government has announced to purchase 50 per cent vaccines from vaccine companies. While all this is clear, the state government is only trying to create confusion. Now that the first dose has been given to citizens above 45 years of age, they need to be given a second dose. The state government says 20 lakh doses are required, of which 10 lakh are available. In other words, there is no justice for Dhad 18 to 44 and no justice for the people above Dhad 45. Such a reaction was given by Darekar.
"Ministers sell vaccines to Bollywood actors illegally" -
Darekar today accused government ministers of selling vaccines to Bollywood actors illegally . What is the similarity between the government giving only 6.5 lakh vaccines to districts like Sangli and Satara and only 2 lakh vaccines to Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts in Konkan? He also demanded that the government should give an account of what the vaccine did to the people.
Maharashtra Lockdown: "If the Mumbai model is so successful, why punish Mumbaikars for another 15 days?"
Maharashtra Lockdown News: "Government does not dare to remove lockdown as it knows the true situation"
The Thackeray government has announced a decision to extend the lockdown in Maharashtra till June 1. The Thackeray government has increased restrictions to control the corona and made a negative RTPCR test report mandatory for foreign travelers. Meanwhile, BJP MLA Nitesh Rane has expressed anger over the decision to increase the lockdown. If the Mumbai model is so successful, then why punish Mumbaikars for another 15 days? He has asked such a question in an interview given to TV9.
"If the Mumbai model advertised by the Thackeray government is so successful, I don't know why they are increasing the lockdown. Basically the numbers are rife and even today people are not getting oxygen, they have to pay for beds. Remedesivir is feeling the shortage. Knowing the true situation, the government does not dare to remove the lockdown. Increasing the lockdown is an indirect acknowledgment that Corona's condition is serious, "said Nitesh Rane.
"If they are boasting so much about the Mumbai model, they are bombing so much, then why don't they reduce the restrictions in Mumbai? Why Mumbaikars sentenced to 15 more days? Why not start a business in Mumbai? "Everything is under control. If the restrictions are lifted, then the state government has sealed the fact that we are lying," he said.
"Money is being spent only for publicity and the truth is being concealed by lying. Why isn't the lockdown lifted when people are dying because of the economic situation? The rains will start in another 15 days. If everything is under control, let the people earn, ”he demanded. All love to Mumbai, so what do people in rural areas want to do? He also asked such a question.
Important News… 1,400 beds available for corona patients in Pimpri Chinchwad!

Rohit Pawar's criticism of the yogi government
The health system in the rural areas of Unnao district is at 3 p.m.
Corona infection is on the rise in Uttar Pradesh. In the rural areas of Unnao district, the health system is at 3 p.m. A large number of bodies are being cremated on the banks of the river Ganga. The bodies are buried in the sand and cremated on the banks of the river Ganga. So the types of desecration of corpses are happening. NCP MLA Rohit Pawar has criticized the Uttar Pradesh government over this issue.
Rohit Pawar said, “It seems that Ganga has literally got the guideline of cremation after death due to Kovid in Uttar Pradesh. This raises the question of whether we are preventing or spreading Karona. Besides, the desecration of corpses is different! What to say It is shocking that there is no cure for life and contempt even after death!
Earlier, about 100 bodies were found on the banks of the river Ganga in Buxar, Bihar. The administration had later speculated that the bodies may have been transported from Uttar Pradesh. The incident has sparked clashes between the Bihar and Uttar Pradesh governments. Meanwhile, bodies have been found on the banks of the Ganges at Ghazipur in Uttar Pradesh after Buxar in Bihar. So one was blown away.
Massive deaths of villagers in many places in rural areas of Unnao
In the rural areas of Unnao, a large number of villagers are dying. Many of those who died had coughs, colds, and difficulty breathing. The death toll in rural areas is likely to be in the thousands, locals said. Around 300 bodies have been buried at Ganga Ghat in Rautapur in Unnao. This is so much so that there is no space left in this place for cremation. Sand began to fall on the banks of the Ganges to bury the dead. At present, the bodies are being cremated in an open space on a leopard. Some bodies are also seen being buried in the fields surrounding the place.
The district collector ruled out the possibility of a corona outbreak
Speaking to media in this regard, Unnao District Collector Ravindra Kumar said that he had received information that bodies were being buried on the banks of Ganga in Buxar. 
 The district collector has ruled out the possibility of corona infestation from these bodies. 
“Lockdown has increased again! Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had said, my family, my responsibility! ”
BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhyay targeted; He has also made a statement about Sharad Pawar
The state's Maha Vikas Aghadi government today announced a decision to increase the lockdown. State Health Minister Rajesh Tope had told the media yesterday that Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray would make an official announcement regarding the extension of the lockdown. After that, the guidelines have been announced by issuing an official order to extend the lockdown till June 1. The decision to maintain strict restrictions till May 31 was taken at the state cabinet meeting as the prevalence of corona is still prevalent in rural areas. As a result, BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhyay has targeted Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, NCP president Sharad Pawar and the Mahavikasaghadi government.
"The Chief Minister has taken responsibility for his family. Sharad Pawar has taken care of the bar owners. You take care of your family. There is no point in relying on the recovery government. In the recovery government, Farhan Akhtar is the darling to give the vaccine to the police, the common man is your guardian. ” This is what Keshav Upadhyay tweeted.
At the same time, “Lockdown has increased again. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had said, "My family, my responsibility!" My father, the state government has released you in a new wave. Look at your EMI, your house expenses, your light bill. ” That is also what Upadhyay has said.
The Thackeray government has tightened the restrictions and made the RTPCR test mandatory for people coming to the state from outside. A negative RTPACRR test report is mandatory for any person entering Maharashtra in any way and the report should have been prepared 48 hours before admission. Meanwhile, the earlier rules would apply to those coming to the state from any part of the country.
A few days back, Sharad Pawar had sent a letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to draw attention to the problems in the hotel business and hospitality sector. Also, I am confident that the Chief Minister will sympathetically consider their demands with a view to providing relief to the professionals in the hospitality sector and under his guidance the people will be relieved from this crisis of Corona. This belief was also expressed by Sharad Pawar. This also shows that Keshav Upadhyay has commented.
"Modern vaccines are being given in and around Mumbai despite the ban"; Nawab Malik's sensational claim
Modern vaccination started even though only three companies are allowed in the country?
With only three companies allowed in the country, how is the modern vaccine system being implemented in France? If the public does not get permission then are they allowed as a special matter? Nawab Malik, National Spokesperson of the Nationalist Congress Party and Minister for Minorities, has demanded that the Center disclose this.
The central government says there is a shortage of vaccines in the country. The central government has approved vaccines from Bharat Biotech, Serum Institute and Sputnik. Meanwhile, Nawab Malik has alleged that information has become available that the modern company is vaccinating in this country and around Mumbai.
Vaccination has been introduced in some hospitals to give Moderna vaccine to citizens of foreign embassies, especially in France. Malik said Indian relatives of embassy citizens were also being vaccinated.
How is the modern vaccine being given when only three companies are allowed? This question has also been raised by Nawab Malik.
Meanwhile, due to shortage of vaccines in the state and the need to vaccinate people above 45 years of age, vaccination of citizens in the age group of 18 to 44 years has been postponed for some time. State Health Minister Rajesh Tope said yesterday that the next decision would be taken based on the availability of vaccines.
Maharashtra Lockdown:… Otherwise no access to Maharashtra; Big decision of Thackeray government
Maharashtra Lockdown News: Lockdown extended till June 1
The Thackeray government has decided to extend the lockdown till June 1 and an official order has been issued. The Thackeray government has announced some new restrictions this time. At this time, the Thackeray government has made the negative RTPCR test report mandatory for those traveling abroad. Without it, it will not be possible to enter Maharashtra from outside the state. The order states that the report should have been issued 48 hours earlier. Meanwhile, the earlier rules would apply to those coming to the state from any part of the country.
In addition, both the driver and the cleaner will be allowed in the cargo carrier. If the cargo carriers are entering from a foreign country, a negative RTPCR test report is mandatory and must be removed within 48 hours, the order said.
It will be the responsibility of the municipality to monitor the local markets as well as the APMC to ensure that the rules of corona are being followed. If the rules are not followed in a place or the situation cannot be handled, the local administration may decide to increase or close the restrictions there.
Airport and port staff who have to travel for medicines and corona-related materials are allowed to travel by local, mono and metro. If a restriction is to be extended in a place, the local administration has been given the right to do so and a notice has to be given 48 hours before the ban is imposed. All these restrictions will be in force till 7 am on June 1.
Strict restrictions have been imposed in the state since April 14 to curb the outbreak of corona. Earlier, the ban was in force till May 1 and then it was extended till May 15. As the deadline expires on Saturday, it was discussed at a state cabinet meeting. Due to this restriction, the corona epidemic in the state has come under control and the growth rate of the state has come down. Although the number of victims of corona in 10 to 15 districts has come down, the number of victims is still high in some districts. Therefore, most of the ministers had made a one-sided demand to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to extend the existing restrictions for another 15 days. Accordingly, it has been decided to increase the lockdown.
The hotel business on the highway started secretly
Fear of increasing corona infection in Palghar district
Palghar: Although hoteliers in the state are allowed to continue parcel services, most of the hotels along the Mumbai-Ahmedabad National Highway are found to be operating secretly around midnight. Parcels during the day and crowds of customers at night can be seen in some hotels. This has led to fears of a new corona infection.
More than 16,000 coroner's cases were found in rural areas of Palghar district in Mumbai and Gujarat in April. In the rural areas of the district, the number of patients was increasing from 800 to 900 per day. At present, due to the lockout, the number of patients has increased from 200 to 250. Under the 'Break the Chain' campaign to bring Corona under control, the state government has allowed hoteliers to provide only parcel services. Despite this, some hoteliers on the highway have been found to have parcel facilities during the day and hotels at night. Fifteen to seventeen large hotels on both sides of the National Highway within the boundaries of the Manor Police Station are secretly open at night. Although a police patrol patrolled the area every hour, no action has been taken against any hotelier so far.
A hotelier near Manor recently died of a corona infection, and some local workers in the state's driver's catering service have reportedly contracted the disease. Truck drivers from Gujarat, Rajasthan, Delhi and other states come to the hotel for dinner. They are admitted through the back door. This type has led to fears of a new corona infection. When contacted, Palghar Superintendent of Police Dattatreya Shinde said only parcel service would be provided from the hotel along the highway.
Meanwhile, hoteliers along the national highway have been accused of being sheltered by the police while ordinary citizens are being prosecuted for violating the law.
Access through the back door
The front shutters of most hotels along the national highway are kept closed. Also, if a two-wheeler or four-wheeler comes in front of the hotel for a meal, they are told by the guard sitting outside the hotel that the hotel is closed. However, truck drivers are allowed to park their vehicles through the second door of the air-conditioned room in the hotel or through the back door of the hotel. Most of the hotels in the Manor area are packed between 9pm and 11pm, according to reliable sources. It is said that many hotels along the highway from Talasari to Virar are also operating in the same manner.
82-year-old patient goes missing from Corona Center in Vasai
The problems are further aggravated by the fact that the patient is not registered in the municipal docket.
Vasai: An 82-year-old elderly citizen was admitted to Varun Karona Treatment Center at Valiv of Vasai-Virar Municipal Corporation for treatment. However, the shocking fact that this patient has been missing for the last few days has come to light. The problems are further aggravated by the fact that the patient is not registered in the municipal docket.
Ramchandra Das (82) of Veer Savarkar Nagar in Vasai was taken to Varun Karona Center on April 22 at around 7.45 pm for treatment. After completing 14 days of treatment, his relatives went to fetch him on May 5, but it was learned that Ramchandra Das was not at the Corona Center. It has been found that there is no record of this patient even in the municipal office.
Since Ramchandra Das has no one, he has been with us for the last several years. So now that he is in Corona, we informed the municipality and admitted him to Varun Industry for treatment. But now they are not there, so where did they go? Even if something happened to them, the municipality should have given us the same information. No such information was received, said Gorachandra Mukherjee, a relative.
Because Ramchandra Das is an old man, he can't walk alone, so how can he disappear from here? Mukherjee has demanded that the municipal corporation should give us proper information in this regard. For this, by informing the officials of the municipality, it is being demanded that the matter should be investigated as to where the patient Ramchandra Das went from Varun Kendra. Municipal Deputy Commissioner Kishor Gavas said that the patient has gone missing and the matter will be thoroughly investigated.

The second wave of corona had created a dire situation in the state. The pace of patient growth has been slowing down over the last few days, with the number of patients declining. However, there is still no noticeable decline in the daily number of patients. Therefore, the state government has decided to increase the lockdown. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray while interacting with the people of the state on Sunday night announced that the lockdown would be extended for 15 days. After the announcement made by the Chief Minister, the BJP has pointed out some issues and asked six questions to the Chief Minister.

Strict restrictions will be in place in districts where the proportion of coronaries affected in the test is 20 per cent or more. The boundaries of such districts will be closed. So that people will not leave this district or citizens from other districts will not come to districts with high number of patients. As it is the farming season, shops for fertilizers, seeds, implements etc. have been allowed to remain open till 2 pm. Local administrations are empowered to make timely decisions.
There will be no time constraint for supply of grains, pulses, fruits, vegetables etc. Can supply goods at any time in shops. Shops can be kept open only after 2 pm for storage of goods. But customers will not be able to sell during that time. If found, strict action has been taken. Hotels are still allowed home delivery service. You can't sit in hotels and enjoy food. These rules will remain in force till 7 am on June 15.
Which shops will be allowed ?
Citizens are more curious about whether they will be allowed to open hairdressing salons, computers, rain gear, clothes etc. In cities or districts with low patient numbers, the local administration may decide. The decision on which and how to allow shops to be opened will be taken at the local level.
' We need a national policy on exams '
The state government decided on the matriculation examination. Now we are reviewing what to do with the 12th standard exam. Let's decide soon. However, the central government will also have to take some decisions regarding post-secondary vocational courses. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said that since the exams are a matter of future for the next generation and the situation is different in different states, there is a need to formulate a national policy on exams and the central government should take that decision.
In a speech to the people of the state on Sunday, Thackeray said that he was ready to send a letter to the central government.

The effects of the second wave of coronavirus in India are slowly
The second wave of the Corona is wreaking havoc on the country.

'No vaccine, no alcohol', notices in front of liquor shops in this district
The Additional Collector of Uttar Pradesh has made a strange rule. The rule has sparked a debate in front of every liquor store in Saifai in Uttar Pradesh's Etawah district.
Citizens are worried about the second wave of corona in the country. The rushing waves wreaked havoc. Experts also doubt that a third wave of corona will occur. So the country is being vaccinated. But many people are ignoring vaccinations. As a solution to this, the Additional District Collector of Uttar Pradesh has made a strange rule. The rule has sparked a debate in front of every liquor store in Saifai in Uttar Pradesh's Etawah district.
Alcohol will not be available in the city without a certificate of vaccination, the notice said. The notice was issued on the instructions of Additional Collector Hem Kumar Singh. This strange order is being hotly debated on social media.
The notice was issued by Hem Kumar Singh after several deaths due to poisoning in Aligarh. Hem Kumar Singh along with district police officers inspected liquor shops in Saifai after the Aligarh poisonous liquor scam. Hem Kumar Singh, meanwhile, explicitly instructed liquor shops to put up notices saying 'no vaccine, no alcohol'. Earlier this month, at least 25 people died in Aligarh after consuming poisonous liquor.
This was also confirmed by the employees of the liquor shops in Saifai. That said. The Additional Collector has told us that by doing so, more and more people will be vaccinated. But Etawah District Excise Officer Kamal Kumar Shukla said no orders had been issued to stop the sale of liquor to those who have not yet received it. However, the efforts of the district administration to promote vaccination should be encouraged, but there are no orders to issue vaccine certificates for the purchase of liquor.
“The use of monoclonal antibody cocktails on corona patients is extremely important”; Opinion of former head of ICMR
Advice to use antibody cocktail 3 to 10 days after corona test positive
Many effective drugs are being used to treat corona patients. There is now a drug added to it. The drug is called 'Antibody Cocktail' and has been approved by the Central Government. Therefore, it is claimed that Corona patient can be cured in a week. The monoclonal antibody cocktail is unlikely to cause further mutations, said Dr. ICMR's former chief scientist. Gangakhedkar said. He advised to use this method rationally.
Antibody cocktails made by Indian pharma company Rosh India are being given to patients with mild symptoms of corona before. The drug was approved for emergency use by the Central Drugs Standards Control Organization (CDSCO).
Dr. Raman Gangakhedkar said on Sunday, "In theory, monoclonal antibody cocktails are unlikely to cause mutations in the virus. A person is more likely to get a moderate to severe illness with an antibody cocktail rather than a virus. ” He gave this information while talking to ANI news agency.
“Antibody cocktails can prevent the virus from recurring. The rational use of antibody cocktails is “essential”. Antibody cocktails should be used within three to ten days after corona infection, ”said Dr. Raman Gangakhedkar said. He also said there was no evidence that monoclonal antibody cocktail treatment could protect against newer variants of the corona.
This cocktail injection is made by combining two types of antibodies, Casirivimab and Imdevimab. A single dose of this injection costs Rs 59,750. This cocktail has been made available in the Indian market by Cipla Company. It can also be used in children weighing more than 40 kg, said Dr Naresh Trehan, a renowned cardiologist and president of Medanta Hospital. Former US President Donald Trump was given an antibody cocktail after being infected with the corona.

Hundreds of bodies were found floating in the river Ganga in Uttar Pradesh in early May. Thousands of bodies were also found buried in the sand on the banks of the river in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Many of these deaths were feared to have been caused by Corona. It was speculated that the relatives of the deceased buried their bodies in the river or carried them away due to lack of money. After several videos and photos of these bodies went viral on social networks, they were noticed by the media in the country as well as the international media.
The country now produces ten times as much oxygen 
Prime Minister Modi's statement in 'Mann Ki Baat'
New Delhi:  Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said that the country was fighting the Corona virus with all its might, adding that oxygen production had been increased tenfold.

The Corona outbreak claimed many lives. 
It has been proven that India does not compromise on the issue of national security.
Initially, there was only one corona testing laboratory in the country, but now there are 2500 laboratories in operation and more than 20 lakh corona tests are being done every day, Modi said. Modi interacted with laboratory technician Prakash Kandpal and listened to his experiences.
After seven decades of independence, 3.5 crore houses were built in rural areas, while 4.5 crore new plumbing connections were provided in the last 21 months, Modi said. He also said that poor patients have got new life due to Ayushman Bharat Yojana. People are satisfied with the arrival of electricity in the village in 70 years. He also pointed out that many rural areas are connected by roads.
During the BJP government, there were many moments that the country would be proud of , but also had to face challenges. Along with national security, development plans were also implemented.
- Narendra Modi , Prime Minister
Test period 
'In the last seven years, India has taken the lead in digital transactions. Records are being set in launching satellites and building roads.

During the Coronation period, India moved forward through service and cooperation. In the first wave we fought bravely. This time too, India will overcome this wave.

The corona virus is a Chinese product; The claim in the dissertation
Research has shown that SARS COV 2 is not a natural ancestor of the corona virus.
LONDON : A study report claims that the virus was created by China using genetic engineering amid growing demand around the world for the origin of the corona virus. Chinese scientists from Wuhan's laboratory joined in, then changed its appearance to show that it came from a tiger and designed it in a way that would make it look natural, according to research presented by British professor Angus Dalgesh and Norwegian scientist Bergk Sorensen.
Research has shown that SARS COV 2 is not a natural ancestor of the corona virus. 
Chinese researchers were experimenting with reverse engineering to create a virus similar to that of bats.
Information about the virus was later destroyed. Even Chinese scientists are not ready to talk about it.
The 22-page dissertation will be published in the journal Science Journal Quarterly Review Biophysics Discovery. 
This makes the virus more contagious.

'100 million doses of Kovishield in June'; Letter of Serum Institute to the Center
"Working day and night to increase production"
The vaccination campaign has slowed down as the country is experiencing a shortage of corona vaccines. Opposition groups called for a boycott of the assembly. For this, additional information about Corona vaccine is being provided by the Central Government to the States and Union Territories. The Union Health Ministry has announced that 12 crore vaccines will be available in June. Now, the Serum Institute has said that it will provide 100 million vaccines to the central government by June. Serum Institute has given a letter to Home Minister Amit Shah in this regard.
"We want to tell you that in June, we will produce and supply 100 million covshield vaccines. In May, 6.5 crore doses were manufactured and supplied. Given the demand in the country, we have increased the production of vaccines. The Serum Institute is committed to caring for the citizens of the country. Our entire team has joined hands with the government to fight against Corona, ”said Prakash Kumar Singh, director of the company's regulatory division.
"We are getting full support from the central government for constructive work. We are working hard to increase production in the years to come, ”he said in his letter.
The letter states that the Covishield vaccine manufacturing company in Pune is working day and night. "We are working hard to meet the demand for corona vaccines in the country," it said. Earlier, Siram had said that 6.5 crore vaccines would be produced in June. It was also said that 70 million vaccines would be produced in July and 100 million in August and September.
Corona virus production in China's Wuhan lab !; Scientists have found evidence
Corona virus man-made?
Arguments are now being fought over how the corona virus was formed after the corona took over the world. Professor Angel Dalglish of Britain and Norwegian scientist Dr. Birger claimed that the corona virus was produced in China's Wuhan lab. For this, he studied the corona virus in depth. He claimed in his report that the study revealed shocking facts. China used retro engineering to hide its black act after creating the corona virus. Also, the virus did not appear to be man-made but spread through bats. However, he claimed that the virus could not have been created without human intervention. China has often been viewed with suspicion.
Corona virus has no natural properties. So they claim that it is completely man-made. It has also been produced in the 'Gain of Function' project. The Chinese took the corona's backbone from the caves in the cave and made it more deadly by putting spikes on it. They claim that the virus was created in a lab because of its human-to-human properties. This was revealed while studying for the production of the corona vaccine. This was reported by Daily Mail.
The information in the Wuhan Lab was deliberately hidden and then attempted to be destroyed. Also, the scientists who raised their voices on this were either silenced or disappeared. Many scientific journals refused to publish the findings of the research. Therefore, China's brass was not exposed, he added.
A World Health Organization team visited Wuhan in January. The team then claimed that the corona was formed naturally.

It is wrong to call Aquarius 'Super Spreader'; Out of 9 lakh tests, only 0.2 per cent report was positive
Only 0.5 per cent of police personnel deployed for Kumbh Mela are infected with coronavirus, a senior official said
A senior police official has said that it is wrong to call the Kumbh Mela a 'super spreader'. He informed that out of the total RTPCR tests conducted in Haridwar from January 1 to the end of Kumbh Mela, only 0.2 per cent came back positive. He also told PTI that only 0.5 per cent of the police personnel deployed for the Kumbh Mela were corona.
Inspector General of Police Sanjay Gunjayal, who is in charge of the Kumbh Mela, said, "When the program started on April 1, the number of patients was increasing due to the second wave of corona in states like Maharashtra and Haryana."
"If we take a closer look at the Kovid data of Haridwar district from January 1 to April 30, it is clear that the attempt to show that Kumbh Mela has become a super spreader in the Corona crisis is wrong," said Sanjay Gunjayal. During the Kumbh Mela, Sanjay Gunjayal was responsible for the security of Haridwar and surrounding areas.
A total of 8 lakh 91 thousand RTPCR tests were conducted in Haridwar between January 1 and April 30. Of these, 1954 tests (0.2 per cent) were positive, he said. Giving another explanation as to why Kumbh Mela cannot be called 'Super Spreader', he said, "16,000 policemen were deployed for Kumbh Mela. As of April 30, only 88, or 0.5 per cent, of the police personnel had contracted coronary heart disease.
The Modi government was heavily criticized for crowding the Kumbh Mela with millions of people across the country. The Kumbh Mela was noticed internationally. On April 17, Modi had symbolically appealed for the program to be carried out.

Central government angry over 'hospital vaccination package' of private hospitals; Orders of action to the states
Warning of legal action against hospitals offering vaccination packages
Some private hospitals have joined hands with luxury hotels to offer corona vaccination packages in violation of the rules and the central government has warned that legal action will be taken against them. The health ministry has written to the states and union territories asking them to ensure proper compliance with the rules while conducting the national corona vaccination campaign.
According to the rules, vaccination can be done in government or private centers, workplaces, social centers, panchayat buildings, schools, colleges, old age homes. Also, vaccinations for senior citizens and persons with disabilities can be arranged by the societies near the home.
Apart from these, it is illegal to plan vaccinations in other places and the Ministry of Health has warned that legal action will be taken against them. Due to this, the Ministry of Health has pointed out that vaccination in big hotels is not in accordance with the rules.
Hotels are offering covid vaccination packages which include accommodation, breakfast, dinner, WiFi as well as vaccinations from expert doctors on request. This had sparked criticism on social media.
Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia had questioned how private hospitals were getting these doses when the Center was not in stock and the Center had stopped vaccinations for 18- to 44-year-olds due to shortage of vaccines. Manish Sisodia had asked, "If the Delhi government wants to vaccinate all the youth for free, how do they become available in private patients when there are no vaccines available for it?" He had noticed that hotels charge Rs 1,000 for this.
Consolation to Indians! The second wave is waning; The pace of growth slowed
Coronavirus updates: Fewer deaths in the country after six weeks
The first wave of Corona hit the second wave while the life of the people passing through Kollam was coming back to normal. Corona's new strain caused the patient population to explode. India recorded an unfortunate one-day world record for the number of corona patients. From February, the situation in the country began to deteriorate. March and April saw the ordeal of death. Unprecedented heart-wrenching conditions were observed for patients outside hospitals, for medical remediation outside, and for funerals outside cemeteries. This dire situation is slowly receding, with statistics showing signs of another wave of corona sweeping the country.

Corona had raised concerns about the growing number of deaths in the country along with the outbreak. Four and a half thousand deaths were reported daily in the country. In a few weeks, the country averaged between three and a half to four thousand deaths a day. As a result, the health system was asleep. However, the number of patients is now slowly declining. Three 460 patients have died in the last 24 hours in the country. However, the death toll is still alarming.
The Center has now stopped the supply of antimicrobial drug to the states. Union Minister Mansukh Mandvi informed about this decision. "Since the states have sufficient reserves, there is no need for supply from the center now. Now the country also has adequate stocks of remedivir. We are cutting off the supply of remedicivir to the states as the supply exceeds the demand, ”he said.

States will no longer receive remedicivir injections from the central government; 'It' is because
Information of Union Minister of State for Chemistry Mansukh Mandavia
Although the second wave of corona was declining, the death toll was setting a record in the last two months due to the growing number of patients and inadequate medical equipment. Demand for oxygen and remedial injections also increased. This led to an increase in the black market for remedivir injections. Police raided several places and seized injectable remedesivir. However, due to declining production, it has become difficult to get Remedesivir injections. Therefore, the central government was supplying remedesivir injection to the states. But now the central government has made it clear that states should buy injections directly from the company. Union Minister of State for Chemicals and Fertilizers Mansukh Mandavia has informed about this.
"I am happy to tell you that the production of Remedesivir injection has increased tenfold. This was made possible by the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. On April 11, 2021, 33,000 injections were being produced daily. Now this product has reached three and a half lakhs, ”tweeted Mansukh Mandavia.
There were 20 factories making Remedesivir injection. Since then, the number has risen to 60. As a result, there is more supply than demand. Therefore, the central government has decided to cut off the supply of remedicivir injection to the states, he added. It has also ordered the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Agency and CDSCO to monitor the availability of remedesivir.
The impact of the second wave is slowly diminishing in the country as well. 
 The number of discharged patients is higher for the 16th consecutive day than the number of infected patients.
Comfortable! Decline in the number of corona patients in Delhi
Delhi's step towards unlock?
The last few days in Delhi have seen a dramatic drop in the number of corona patients. In the last 24 hours, nearly 900 crore patients have been registered, according to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. This is the first time such a low number of patients has been reported in the second wave of Corona. At the same time, the death rate in Delhi has come under control. Therefore, there is a positive picture that Delhi is taking a step towards unlock.
Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal inaugurated the 'Drive Through Vaccination' at Chhatrasal Stadium in Delhi. Then Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal gave this information. Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia was also present with him. Delhi currently has a lockdown till May 31. In view of the Corona situation in Delhi, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had extended the lockdown for the fifth time. Metro service has also been suspended during this period. So now the focus is on what Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal decides.
Although the number of patients in Delhi has come down, the vaccination drive has slowed down. Therefore, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has planned to buy vaccines from abroad. Delhi's health ministry has launched a global tender to procure 10 million doses. June 7 is the last date for submission of proposals for this tender.
The impact of the second wave is slowly diminishing in the country as well. For the second day in a row, less than two lakh Corona patients were found in the country. A total of 1.73 lakh new Corona patients have been found in the last 24 hours. This is the lowest number in the last 45 days. During this period, 3617 people have lost their lives due to corona. The number of discharged patients is higher for the 16th consecutive day than the number of infected patients. In the last one day alone, 2.48 lakh patients have been cured. With this, the recovery rate in India has now reached 90 per cent and is expected to grow rapidly. There are currently 22,28,724 active cases of corona in India.
IMA challenges yoga guru Ramdev Baba for open discussion!
The Uttarakhand IMA, outraged by the remarks made by yoga guru Ramdev Baba about doctors treating corona in the country, has challenged Ramdev Baba for an open discussion.
Yoga guru Ramdev Baba's statement about Karona's treatment in hospitals has caused a great deal of controversy in the country. The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has strongly objected to Ramdev Baba's statement. The IMA has written a letter to the Center to protest the statement and a case has also been registered against Ramdev Baba. Against this backdrop, on the one hand, the central board of the IMA is demanding that Ramdev Baba withdraw his statement completely, but now the Uttarakhand IMA has directly challenged Ramdev Baba to have an open discussion. Ramdev Baba had announced a list of about 25 questions addressed to the doctors. Since then, this challenge has been given by Uttarakhand IMA.
In the viral video, Ramdev Baba said
A few days ago, a video of Ramdev Baba went viral on social media. In it, he claimed that a thousand doctors had died even after he had been vaccinated against both coronaviruses. "What kind of doctor is he who can't save himself?" He was also seen asking such a question.
After this video, another video of Ramdev Baba went viral. In it, “People sometimes run the trend of arresting Ramdev Baba on social media and sometimes Ramdev Baba runs the trend of being a thug. Keep going, but now we’ve learned these qualities as well, and the trends we run are also at the top. Even his father can't arrest him, "he said.
Demand to file a case of treason
Outraged by all this, the IMA, the apex body of doctors, sent a notice of Rs 1,000 crore to Ramdev Baba. He also apologized for his statement. Not to be outdone, IMA has also written a letter directly to Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding that a treason case be filed against yoga guru Ramdev Baba .
"We don't bow to them"
Meanwhile, speaking about the complaint filed against Ramdev Baba, IMA central president Dr. G. A. Jayalal said, "We have nothing to do with Ramdev Baba. If Ramdev Baba withdraws his statement completely, we will withdraw our complaint. We think his statements can create confusion among the people. We are scared because we have so many followers. ”
Against this backdrop, now that Uttarakhand IMA has challenged Ramdev Baba for an open discussion, what steps will be taken by him will be important.

Full vaccination by December
Covishield and covacin vaccines are being used for vaccination.
Testimony of Union Minister Prakash Javadekar
New Delhi: Despite three per cent vaccination in the country so far, 216 crore doses of corona vaccine will be given by December, meaning 108 crore people will be vaccinated in the next six months, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said on Friday.
Replying to a question at a press conference after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi criticized the Modi government for not having a vaccination policy, Javadekar said, "If vaccination is really a concern, look at what is going on in the Congress-led states. These states have not even lifted the quota of vaccines given by the Center for the age group of 18 to 44 years.
Covishield and covacin vaccines are being used for vaccination. In addition, Zydus Cadila vaccines, NovaVax, Sputnik and Genova will be available. Foreign vaccines can also be found in the country. As a total of 216 crore vaccines will be produced, complete vaccination will be done before the end of 2021, said Javadekar.
Rahul Gandhi says vaccination is the solution, but we have been saying it since the first day of the Corona disaster. "India has become the second fastest and most vaccinated country in the world to vaccinate 200 million people," Javadekar said.
Discussions are underway to import vaccines from foreign companies Pfizer and Moderna, with Pfizer vaccines expected to be available in India by July. Referring to this, Javadekar said, "The availability of vaccines in the country will increase from August."
Addressing the Congress, Javadekar said, "It is now clear that you have created a toolkit. He no longer needs any evidence. The kind of language you are using and creating confusion and fear in people's minds is part of the same politics.
Who opposed Kovacin?
Rahul Gandhi said that the country has become the capital of vaccine production. Referring to it, he said, "Kovacin is a vaccine made entirely in India. However, Congress leaders were skeptical about the usefulness of Kovacin. People were misrepresenting that they should not take covacin. A Congress leader had even ridiculed this vaccine as 'Modi vaccine'. But Modi has taken the covacin vaccine, said Javadekar.
Everything according to the toolkit
According to the script of the Congress' Toolkit, Rahul Gandhi used the term 'habit of drama' for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. "It is an insult to the country to use abusive words against Modi while he is fighting against Corona," Javadekar said.

"Center creates artificial scarcity for the benefit of vaccine companies"; Serious allegation of 'you'
"Many countries around the world have allowed the use of different vaccines. So why is the emergency use of only three vaccines approved in our own country?
The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has accused the Center of creating an artificial shortage of vaccines for the benefit of vaccine companies such as Bharat Biotech and Serum. The Delhi BJP, on the other hand, has defended itself by saying that the allegations are baseless.
Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson Atishi made this revelation while speaking at a press conference. She said the government's vaccination campaign has stalled in many places across the country. But vaccinations at different rates continue in private hospitals. In India, Serum Institute's Covishield and Bharat Biotech's Covacin vaccines are currently available in India. A small amount of Russian-made Sputnik V is also being given.
This is a very big racket. Young people are vaccinated free of cost at government vaccination centers. There is a shortage of vaccines, but Atishi has alleged that vaccines are being given at a higher rate in private hospitals. Why is the central government not allowing emergency use of more vaccines? He has also raised such a question.
“Many countries around the world have allowed the use of different vaccines. The Pfizer vaccine is approved by 85 countries and the Moderna vaccine is approved by 46 countries. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine has been adopted by 41 countries. So why was the emergency use of only three vaccines approved in our own country? If the World Health Organization approves these vaccines, why doesn't India? "It is clear that the central government is creating an artificial shortage for the benefit of Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech," he alleged.
Although both these companies do not have production capacity, other vaccines are not allowed by the central government. The central government is ordering states to buy vaccines from only these two companies, she said.
Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor has denied the allegations. The allegations are baseless and the government has not created such a shortage. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's specialty is to create scarcity and inconvenience the common man.
Corona is an orphan; Many pets and birds are homeless!
Due to the economic crisis, people are not able to take care of the animals.
We have all been hit by the Corona epidemic since last year. Corona bereaved her loved ones, orphaned many, and inflicted severe wounds on many. This corona did not leave the animals alone. Many pets have also become homeless and orphaned during this period.
Animal rights activists say many have left their pets and birds on the streets during the epidemic, while others have left them in shelters and orphanages for animals.
Abhinav Shirhan, an animal rights activist from Delhi, says, "We have seen many people leave their pets, especially dogs and birds, outside shelter homes. The lockdown also alienated those who cared for them on the streets. So these animals and birds are very sick. ”
He further says, “It is becoming difficult to reach the animals through the police as the activists of the organizations working for the animals are also being stopped. While trying to rescue a dog, I was stopped by the Delhi Police and had to pay a fine of Rs 2,000 despite having all the documents.
Experts say that many people have to give up their animals because of the financial loss. In the same way, the housemaids who came to the society were not allowed to give animals to them as they were banned during this period. ”
Kaveri Rana Bharadwaj, a animal rights activist from Greater Noida, said, “It is very sad to see so many animals being orphaned and homeless during this time. I urge the authorities concerned to consider these animals as well. ”
Crisil Report: Bicycle industry booms in Ain Karonakala! The biggest increase in a decade!
During the lockdown period, the last fiscal year saw a sharp decline in the bicycle industry, while other industries in the country saw a sharp decline.
Everyone knows that the Corona crisis has been raging in the country for the last one year. During this period a large number of restrictions were imposed on the public life of the citizens. The lockdown forced billions of people to stay indoors. Many states still have more or less lockdown restrictions. Against this backdrop, while the graph of many other industries is coming down, the days of harvesting for the bicycle manufacturing industry in India have come. In the last financial year, during the Ain Corona lockdown , the demand for bicycles in the country has increased by 20%! This is the largest increase in the bicycle industry in the last decade, according to figures released by Crisil.
Fitness and free time!
According to Crisil, the demand for bicycles in the last financial year was around 12 million. However, in the current financial year, it will increase to 1 crore 45 lakhs. Crisil's report also found that public awareness of fitness and the large amount of free time spent at home during the Corona period contributed to this.
Demand for premium-kids bicycles increases!
The bicycles produced are generally classified into 4 types. There are four types: Standard, Premium, Kids and Export. Of these, standard bicycles account for about 50 per cent of the total demand. These types of bicycles are purchased directly from the government and distributed in various schemes. After that, the demand for premium and kids bicycles is around 40 per cent. Demand for this specialty has grown significantly as a result of fitness and leisure time. After this, the demand for export and other types of bicycles is 10 per cent.
… So the bicycle industry booms!
According to Crisil, two factors contributed to the rapid growth of the bicycle industry. One is that the demand for premium and kids type bicycles has increased by as much as 50 per cent. Secondly, the demand for premium and kids bicycles does not fluctuate much depending on their price. Therefore, even if the price of raw material like steel, which accounts for about 60 to 65 per cent of the cost of production, changes, the producers have no problem in increasing the cost. This has helped to grow the business of bicycle manufacturers as a whole.
Sales will increase as soon as the lockdown opens!
Meanwhile, sales of bicycles have not grown as much as expected as all shops are currently closed during the lockdown. However, Crisil predicts that sales will increase significantly in the next quarter, with the number of patients declining and the number of vaccinations increasing in the three months from April to June.
With the help of yoga many countries overcame the corona; Statement of Union Ministers
"Prime Minister Modi made the world aware of ancient customs"
Union AYUSH Minister Shripad Naik has said that the Modi government's global awareness on yoga has helped many countries to fight against Corona. He was speaking on the occasion of distribution of 'AYUSH' 64 medicine used for corona treatment at Naik Panaji on Friday.
"Narendra Modi's government started celebrating Yoga Day globally on June 21 seven years ago. This has created a lot of awareness among the people about yoga, ”said the Union Minister. Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant was also present on the occasion.
“Many countries now understand the importance of yoga in combating coronation. Because they have been informed about the benefits, ”said Naik. Calling Modi a visionary leader, he lauded him for awakening the world to the ancient tradition of focusing on the physical, mental and spiritual aspects of human life.
The state government is seeking the help of AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy) doctors in the treatment of Kovid-19, said Chief Minister Sawant. "AYUSH clinics have also been set up in government health centers in the state, where other health problems are treated after recovery from covid," Sawant said.
Meanwhile, doctors from the Indian Medical Association had demanded action against yoga guru Ramdev Baba for making controversial statements about allopathy. Since then, Union ministers have said that yoga has helped countries around the world overcome the Corona.
"India is not great because of Modi, India has become infamous"
Today, people abroad do not even want to sit in the cars of Indian taxi drivers
Former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath visited the homes of health workers who died of corona infection while serving at the Corona Center in Maihar and consoled the relatives. Later, in a press conference held at the Circuit House, Kamal Nath targeted the central government and the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government in the state. Kamal Nath criticized India today for not being a great country but a notorious country. Kamal Nath also referred to the refusal of Indian taxi drivers abroad to travel in their vehicles.
He also blamed Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the central government under him for tarnishing the country's image and the country's reputation around the world. The Modi government will complete its seven-year term on May 30. On this occasion, the Modi government should answer to the people whether the country will run only on announcements. What happened to the job seekers? Kamal Nath demanded that the Center should give an answer as to what happened to inflation.
In a press conference, Kamal Nath directly accused the BJP and BJP supporters and said that a cowardly mafia has been formed in Madhya Pradesh. I started a war for the pure against the Corona Mafia. But today BJP leaders are selling ventilators, beds, injections. Getting the state out of the pit in which it is being pushed is challenging. 70% of Madhya Pradesh's economy is dependent on agriculture. But in the current situation, the economic condition of the middle class has become worrisome. The lower middle class has now become poorer and the situation of the poor has worsened, said Kamal Nath.
Kamal Nath blamed the Center and the state government for the Karona situation. The second wave had been known for months, but no preparations had been made. Vaccines were announced during the election period but were not received later. Tola Kamal Nath accused the Center and the state government of talking about global tenders.
When asked, an FIR is lodged if the truth is shown, said Kamal Nath. Why Shivraj does not keep all the statistics in front of the public. Why doesn't he openly say how many people have been vaccinated ?, asked Kamal Nath. While answering another question, BJP has not been given the contract of religion. We are also religious but we do not show off. Kamal Nath also said that if I go to any religious place, BJP's stomach starts hurting.
Bank employee arrives at office on oxygen support; Shocking type in PNB Bank
Alleged forcing her to work even when she was having trouble breathing
The inhuman face of Punjab National Bank has come to light in Bokaro, Jharkhand. An employee of PNB has accused the authorities of harassment. After recovering from coronation, he has been accused of forcing her to work even when she is having trouble breathing.
The incident took place at Punjab National Bank in Bokaro's Sector 4. Arvind Kumar, who works in a bank, was infected with corona a few days back. He said that he recovered after 10 days of fever. After recovering from it, he started having lung problems. They have been on oxygen support ever since. He has alleged that even in such a situation, the bank officials called him to work. They also had a dispute over salary. No one accepted him after he resigned out of frustration.
A video of Arvind Kumar, who lives in Sector 2, Bokaro, has gone viral on social media. He had gone to the bank with oxygen support after repeated calls by the bank. He was accompanied by his family. Arvind had put an oxygen mask on his face. He then shouted out his problems. The screams made it difficult for them to breathe. Arvind then asked the authorities for an answer but no one said anything.
Meanwhile, PNB Bank officials did not respond to a request for comment. Everyone was silent after the question was asked.
Where did the four crore vaccines go ?; Large differences in production and vaccination statistics
No dose of covacin has been given in 14 states and union territories
In India, the supply of corona vaccines is a matter of contention between the state and the center. In many states, the vaccination process is slow due to lack of adequate vaccines. However, questions are now being raised about the number of vaccines manufactured by Bharat Biotech in Hyderabad. There are reports of discrepancies in the total production and supply figures of covacin produced by Bharat Biotech.
According to official figures, 21 million doses of covacin were administered by Thursday morning. According to the Times of India, there are now more than six crore vaccines available in the country. It also counts the number of vaccines for export. As per the information given by Bharat Biotech on April 20, 1.5 crore doses were prepared in March. It also said that two crore doses would be produced by the month of April. Krishna Ella, the company's chief executive officer, said the company's revenue from vaccines would reach Rs 3 crore in May.
That is why the company did not produce vaccines as expected, but by the end of May, five and a half crore vaccines should have been available. According to information provided by the Center on two separate affidavits, two crore vaccines were produced in a month. One of the affidavits has been filed before the High Court on May 24. According to Ella, who started the vaccination campaign in the country on January 5, the company had stocks of two crore vaccines before the vaccination campaign started. Considering these vaccines too, the total number of vaccines goes up to one and a half crores.
Considering the vaccine production figures for January and February out of this Rs 7.5 crore, the total number of vaccines is around Rs 8 crore. Vaccine production was lower in January and February compared to March and April. Some of these vaccines were exported under vaccine diplomacy. However, India sent a total of 66 million doses of vaccines abroad. The highest dose of this was Covishield vaccine. Assuming that the dose of covacin is two crore, there should be six crore vaccines available in the country at present. However, it is said that only two crore vaccines are available. From all these addition and subtraction, it seems that the calculation of four crore doses is not clear.
Delhi is one of the leading vaccinators in the country, accounting for 31 per cent of the total vaccines. No dose of covacin has been given in 14 states and union territories of the country. The other five states have less than five per cent of the total vaccination of covacin vaccines.
Delhi's mission unlocked; Chief Minister Kejriwal's big decision
The lockdown will be lifted gradually with some restrictions
Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has said that the lockdown in Delhi will be lifted gradually in the wake of the Corona outbreak. He said the decision was taken as the number of corona patients in Delhi was declining.
He informed about this in a press conference today. The lockdown was prompted by the growing number of patients in Delhi. However, now that the number of patients is declining, the lockdown in Delhi will be phased out. "We are going to gradually remove the lockdown in Delhi on the advice of the people of Delhi and experts," Kejriwal said. However, this time the number of corona patients will increase again or not will be taken care of.
Chief Minister Kejriwal further said that the number of corona patients in Delhi is now declining drastically. In the last 24 hours, the incidence rate has come down to 1.5 per cent and about 1,100 patients have been found infected. The hard work of Delhiites in this battle against Corona is bearing fruit. The situation in Delhi is improving. And so Delhi is now ready to unlock. Construction sites and factories will start from Monday.
Kejriwal said, "We have to remember that the corona has just gone down, not gone." That is why we are slowly unlocking Delhi. Getting up at once can increase the risk of infection. For this unlock, we have put in front the wage earners, the poor people.
 Doctors, staff beaten to death after death of patient; Passing relatives carrying bodies
Shocking incident in the capital of Uttar Pradesh
Although the number of new patients with corona has decreased over the past few days in the second wave of corona, the number of deaths due to corona is worrying. The corona kills more than 3,000 people a day in the country. In some places relatives have been seen expressing anger at doctors after a patient died of coronary heart disease. In the last few months, there have been reports of attacks on doctors and vandalism of hospitals in different parts of the country. Recently, a case came to light in Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh. At a hospital here, a young woman died of corona after her relatives beat up doctors. Not only that, but the relatives passed by throwing the body of this young woman in the car violating the rules regarding corona.
A man named Sunil Mishra had taken his wife Shaila Mishra to the Advanced Neuro and General Hospital in Lucknow for treatment. Shaila's condition was so worrying that after her test, her CT score was between 25 and 22. In such a situation, Shaila was earlier refused admission. However, according to the rules for admitting corona patients, the doctors treated Shaila. However, Shaila died on May 25. After receiving the news of Shaila's death, her relatives went to the hospital and caused a commotion. The relatives beat up the doctors, cleaners and nurses at the hospital. They also argued with the hospital receptionist. Considering the seriousness of the case, the hospital administration called the police.
According to the hospital administration, police arrived at the spot but did not take any action. The hospital administration alleged that the police were only standing and watching the incident and the relatives of the patient were making a fuss. The shocking thing is that after such a commotion, the relatives took Shaila's body out of the car with them. Shaila's body was not sealed according to Corona rules. However, his relatives violated all the rules and took the body and fled the scene. Police have registered a case against Shaila's relatives in this regard. A case has been registered against 24 people for assaulting a doctor and police have launched an investigation. Police are investigating with the help of CCTV.
The hospital administration claimed that many of Shaila's relatives had been drinking. It is said that these people beat him up under the influence of alcohol. The hospital staff said that after 13 days, they threatened to come again and beat us up.
'Antibody Cocktail' drug now in India; The patient can be cured in a week
Dr. from Hyderabad. Important information given by Nageshwar Reddy
Emphasis is being placed on the use of more and more effective drugs to treat corona patients, with the addition of a single drug. The drug used by former US President Donald Trump after Corona has also become available in India. The drug is called 'Antibody Cocktail' and has been approved by the Central Government. So the corona patient can be cured in a week. The President of AIG Hospital in Hyderabad, Dr. This information has been given by Nageshwar Reddy. India Today has reported about this.
Former US President Donald Trump was treated with an 'antibody cocktail' after he was infected with the corona. The drug was discussed after it was used on Trump. Since then, the Indian government has also allowed its use, said Dr. AIG Hospital in Hyderabad. D. Nageshwar Reddy gave important information about it.
AIG Hospital has started using 'Antibody Cocktail' in treatment. At the same time, a comprehensive study is being done on how effective it is on new mutations, Reddy said. "Because of the use of this drug, a corona patient can have a negative RT-PCR test within a week. We are studying at AIG how effective the 'antibody cocktail' is on the double mutation of the corona, "said Reddy.
“While evidence of the effect of antibody cocktails has not yet been established, tests published in various journals, including the New England Journal of Medicine, are encouraging. 
Antibody cocktails reduce the risk of hospitalization or death by 70 per cent, ”said Reddy. 
Former President Donald Trump was treated with an antibody cocktail. 
Then the discussion started. 
This treatment reduces the patient's chances of hospitalization by 70. 
The antibody cocktail is made up of two different antibodies and is developed in a laboratory.
Why are so many children dying in this country because of covid?
It has been more than a year since the coronation began.
However, the situation is not under control.
Corona deaths are currently on the rise in Brazil.
There is ample evidence that the corona virus reduces the mortality rate of young children and adolescents.
But the situation is a little different in Brazil.
Corona has so far killed 1,300 children in Brazil.
A doctor had refused to see Jessica Ricerte's one-year-old son.
He said at the time that the child's symptoms did not match Corona's.
But within the next two months, the boy died of coronary heart disease.
Jessica, who is a teacher, had a miscarriage after two years of infertility treatment.
She says, "Our child was a ray of hope for us.
He brought light into our dark lives.
He gave us so much joy that we never imagined."
Jessica's son was named Lucas.
Lucas first had a problem with loss of appetite.
He used to eat well.
At first, Jessica thought that this was likely to happen because of teething.
Then Lucas began to have a fever.
He started having trouble breathing.
Problems increased by not testing the covid
Jessica took Lucas to the hospital.
According to Jessica, the doctors checked the oxygen level in Lucas' body.
This level had dropped to 86 percent.
It was then that I realized that things were going well.
Lucas didn't have much fever.
The doctor said, "Don't worry.
Covid doesn't need to be tested.
He's having a sore throat."
Doctors told Jessica that covid-19 is extremely rare in young children.
The doctor gave Jessica some antibiotics and sent her home.
“We completed a 10-day course of antibiotics prescribed by a doctor,” says Jessica.
On the last day, Lucas' symptoms subsided.
But his fatigue persisted.
This made me more concerned about the corona virus.
“I sent several videos of him to his nurses, relatives, mother-in-law and others,” she says.
But many told me that I was thinking too much.
They advised me to avoid watching the news.
They thought that I was afraid of all these things for no reason.
But I knew my son was really having trouble breathing.
This is the story of May 2020.
By then, the corona virus had begun to spread.
Two people were killed in the city of Sierra in the Tamboril area in northeastern Brazil.
At that time, the whole city was shocked.
Jessica's husband, Israel, feared that Lucas and Jessica could be infected with the corona if they were taken to another hospital.
But for the next few weeks, Lucas slept a little more.
Finally, on June 3, after the meal, Lucas began to vomit again and again.
Jessica was rushed to a local hospital for a corona test.
His nurse said he tested positive for corona.
MIS status in most children
The hospital did not even have a rescuer at the time, Jessica said.
Lucas was sent to the pediatric intensive care unit in Sobral.
It was two hours away.
After moving there, Lucas realized that he was suffering from Multi-System Syndrome (MIS).
MIS is a condition in which your immune system is active beyond its limits.
This causes swelling in the vital organs.
According to experts, this condition is more likely to develop in children over six weeks of age after a corona infection.
But it is also said to be extremely rare.
Dr. who works as an accompanying pathologist at the University of So Paulo.
They have seen the most cases of MIS during corona outbreaks.
However, in all the cases, the children did not die, he said.
When Lucas was admitted to the hospital, Jessica was not allowed to stay in his room.
Jessica called her niece there.
She says, "We could hear the beep-beep of the machine.
The sound kept coming until the machine stopped.
It predicted the death of the person.
The machine stopped for a few minutes and started again.
We both started crying when we saw it."
Lucas had a heart attack.
But he was rescued, doctors said.
Pediatrician Dr. Manuela Monte had treated Lucas in Sobral's ICU for a month.
Lucas's condition was very serious.
But I was worried about him because there was no reason for him to have such serious symptoms, she said.
According to Lohona Tavarez, a pediatrician at the Albert Sabin Children's Hospital in Fortaleza, the state capital, the majority of children infected with corona have other illnesses, such as diabetes, heart disease and obesity.
But that was not the case with Lucas.
Lucas remained in the ICU for 33 days.
Jessica was only able to meet him 3 times during that period.
Lucas needed immunoglobulin medication to treat his heart.
This drug is very expensive.
But fortunately one patient gave a dose of this medicine to the hospital.
Lucas was in critical condition and needed another dose of immunoglobulin.
Red spots began to appear on his body now.
He developed a fever.
He needed an artificial system to breathe.
Lucas' health improved slightly.
He began to breathe on his own.
So the doctor removed the tube.
After regaining consciousness, he made a video call to Jessica and Israel so that Lucas would not feel alone.
“He started crying when he heard our voices,” Jessica said.
That was our son's last reaction to our talk.
In the next video call, however, he felt as if all the energy in the boy was gone.
The doctor told us to have a CT scan.
It turned out that Lucas had a stroke.
Jessica-Israel, on the other hand, was told that Lucas' health was improving.
He will be taken out of the ICU and placed in the general ward, doctors said.
Jessica says, "I kept my mobile silent that day.
Lucas came in my dream too.
He was kissing my nose.
It was a feeling of love and devotion for me.
I woke up very happy the next day.
Doctors said after Jessica's call, "Lucas's heartbeat and oxygen levels were dropping very fast.
Awareness from Jessica
Jessica still thinks that if Lucas had undergone a covid test in May after his first visit to the hospital, he would be alive today.
Corona, Brazil
She says, "If the doctor doesn't confirm that you have covid, you should have a corona test to confirm it.
Lucas's health deteriorated to such an extent that it was only because of the delay in proper treatment.
Dr. "It's very difficult to stop MIS," says Monte.
Jessica is now raising awareness by telling the story of Lucas.
I would have been more careful if I had known, she said.
How low is the risk of covid in young children?
Dr. Fatima Marinho says, "There is a misconception that there is no risk of covid in young children.
A report has found that young children also have a high incidence of corona infection.
According to the Brazilian Ministry of Health, between February 2020 and March 15, 2020, Kovid-19 killed 852 children under the age of 9 and 518 children under the age of one.
Dr. According to Mourinho, the figure could double.
Meanwhile, deaths due to unspecified acute respiratory syndrome have also increased compared to last year.
The corona virus has claimed the lives of 2,060 children under the age of 9, including 1,302 children.
What is the reason for this?
Experts believe that the number of corona infections in the country is higher because of the high incidence of corona infection in children in Brazil.
Renato Cafuri, president of the Scientific Department of Immunization at the Brazilian Society of Pediatrics, says, "Our country has a high incidence of coronary heart disease.
The number of corona sufferers was second only to the number of days Brazil went to before India overtook them.
There is a shortage of oxygen in the whole country.
There is also a shortage of medicines.
Many hospitals in the country are short of ICU beds.
Brazilian President Zaire Bolsonaro has opposed the lockdown.
A new variant called P.1 has also been found in the country.
This variant is considered more contagious.
Corona deaths have more than doubled in the past few days compared to the first wave of the epidemic.
The prevalence of corona in young children has increased due to less testing.
Mourinho says young children become aware of their corona infection only after they become seriously ill.
There are difficulties in identifying patients.
Not testing the right amount.
This leads to late detection of infection.
As a result, treatment is delayed. "
The lack of tests alone is not the only reason why children develop coronary heart disease.
But other problems that are found in children, different symptoms at different ages also cause many problems.
She says, "In addition to the symptoms of normal covid, children have problems with diarrhea.
They have pain in the abdomen and chest.
Moreover, poverty and lack of health facilities are also considered as a factor.
A study was conducted on 5,857 coronaviruses under the age of 20 years.
Other illnesses and socio-economic problems are also a factor in the deaths of children from corona.
Most of the patients are from black and poor families.
Help cannot reach them.
These children are at high risk of death.
People living in small houses do not observe social distance.
They do not have access to ICUs early, Marinho said.
In addition, these children are more prone to malnutrition.
Therefore, these children have very low immunity.
Mourinho says, "Covid has caused a lot of financial hardship.
In one year, 7 million to 2.1 million people could fall below the poverty line.
People are suffering from malnutrition.
Brian Susa of the Sओo Paulo School of Medicine has done some research on this.
According to him, a group of children is at higher risk of corona.
This should be considered when vaccinating covid.
There is currently no vaccination system for children under 16 years of age.
Death in the absence of parents is unfortunate
Relatives cannot visit children in the ICU for fear of corona infection.
Cinera Kaineiro says, "This situation is very challenging.
Only parents can tell their children how they feel.
Only parents can understand their children's grief.
Parents are very stressed when they hear about their children's health.
They want to spend time with their children.
It is very unfortunate that children die in the absence of their parents, said Dr. Carneiro thinks.
According to scientists, the risk of death in children in this age group is still extremely low.
According to current statistics, 3 lakh 45 thousand people have died due to corona in Brazil so far.
Of these, 0.58 per cent are in the age group of zero to 9 years.
That number is more than 2,000.
Corona: Why do Indians go to Nepal to get the Chinese vaccine?
April 14, 2021 Medical staff at Teku Hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal's capital, were shocked to learn of some of the people who had come to get the vaccine.
These people had big bags.
Sagar Raj Bhandari, director of Teku Hospital, told BBC Nepali: "It is because of these people that we know that corona vaccine is being used like this.
In a way, it is like abusing corona vaccine.
We told them that we cannot vaccinate you.
Some even put pressure on us in various ways. "
The Chinese embassy in Nepal said on its website that visas are issued by China to those who have been vaccinated in China.
Nepali officials suspect that Indian businessmen are coming to Nepal to get business visas to do business with Chinese companies and injecting Chinese-made vaccines.
Covacin and covshield vaccine are being produced in India.
Russia's Sputnik V vaccine has also been allowed in India for emergency use.
India has set an age limit for vaccination.
The vaccine is not made available to everyone.
Dev Chandra Lal Karna, spokesperson of Kathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport, said that a large number of Indians have been arriving in Kathmandu in the last few days.
Indians are allowed to travel from Nepal to other countries.
It requires a no-objection certificate.
Many Indian travelers have such letters, says Dev Chandra Lal Karna.
At present, only two airlines are operating in India and Nepal.
It has also been asked to continue with the air bubble system.
Air traffic between Nepal and China continues.
The number of no-objection certificates issued by the Indian Embassy in Kathmandu has increased in the last few days.
What is the status of vaccination in Nepal?
In Nepal, people between the ages of 40 and 59 are being vaccinated between March 31 and April 19, 2021.
In addition, people who travel to China for business or family reasons or for medical reasons are also vaccinated.
According to the Government of Nepal, more than 50,000 people have been vaccinated in the first 10 days.
Joint Spokesperson of the Health Department of the Government of Nepal, Dr. Sameer Kumar Adhikari said, "Initially, we had asked people to see their identity cards.
Now, the district health officer has been told in writing that the inquiry into identity cards should be made mandatory."
Meanwhile, Nepali officials have said that Indians living in Nepal and involved in small businesses here will be vaccinated.
Corona: Nawab Malik says Center orders companies not to supply drugs to Maharashtra
NCP spokesperson and minister Nawab Malik has strongly accused the central government of ordering companies not to supply medicines to Maharashtra.
Nawab Malik has made these allegations through social media.
Nawab Malik said, "When the Maharashtra government asked about 16 exporting companies about Remedesivir, they got shocking information.
The central government had ordered these companies not to supply drugs to Maharashtra.
In today's scenario, the Maharashtra government will have no choice but to confiscate the stock of remedicivir from these companies and deliver it to the needy, Nawab Malik said.
After these serious allegations of Nawab Malik, reactions have started coming from Maharashtra BJP.
BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhyay said, "Instead of making such baseless allegations, Nawab Malik should give evidence if he has any.
Is the allegation made by Nawab Malik the role of the Maharashtra government?
If so, then Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray should come forward and clarify the truth.
Or these ministers should be stopped from making irresponsible and baseless allegations.
Meanwhile, it will be important to see how the central government reacts to Nawab Malik's allegations.
At present, there are signs that the allegations between the BJP and the Mahavikas Aghadi government in Maharashtra are about to change.
Corona: Actor Sonu Sood positive, gave a 'yes' message to the fans
Actor Sonu Sood has contracted the corona virus.
Sonu Sood tweeted, "Hello friends, I want to let you know that my corona test came back positive.
So I quarantined myself."
Also, "There is no reason to worry.
On the contrary, I will have more time to solve your problems.
Remember, if there is any problem, I am with you," Sonu added.
Sonu Sood actor's leader?
Meanwhile, after the nationwide lockdown was announced last year, many extended a helping hand to the needy in various ways.
But the most talked about was the relief work done by actor Sonu Sood.
Sonu was praised for her words in movies, from villain to real life.
But Sonu Sood's help is now in dispute.
For the past two months, actor Sonu Sood has been working to bring home workers trapped in Mumbai due to a lockdown.
Sonu sent home workers from Bihar, Assam, Uttar Pradesh and many other states.
People tweet to Sonu Sood for help.
Many have even tweeted a list of people going out of town.
Even when the government did not start trains, Sonu Sood was planning a bus to send the workers home.
Sonu's 'film' career
Sonu Sood has worked in Hindi, English, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Punjabi and Chinese cinema.
He started his career in 1999 with the Tamil film 'Kallazhagar'.
Sonu Sood is originally from Punjab and has been living in Mumbai for the last few years.
His father had a business and his mother was a professor.
Sonu graduated from the Engineering College, Nagpur.
Sonu then moved to Mumbai to work in modeling and cinema.
The struggle for a job started in Mumbai.
At that time, Sonu was struggling to get a job in cinema.
But Sonu got her first opportunity in Delhi for an advertisement.
He then landed a role in Tamil cinema.
He then started acting in Tamil, Telugu and Kannada movies.
For that he had to learn these languages.
Sonu made her Bollywood debut in 2002 with the Hindi film Shahid-e-Azam.
After that, he acted in some Hindi movies like Yuva, Aashiq Banaya Aapne, Shoot Out At Wadala, Jodha Akbar, Dabangg, Happy New Year, Paltan, R Rajkumar.
Work in Chinese cinema
Sonu Sood has also acted in Chinese language movies.
Sonu has acted in the movie 'Kung Fu Yoga' in 2017.
For this, he had trained in China with Jackie Chan's son.
Jackie Chan along with Sonu had also done promotions in India for this movie.
In 1996, Sonu married his girlfriend Sonali.
Sonu and Sonali met while studying in Nagpur.
They have two children, Ishant and Ayan.
This is not his first social work, though it has come to light thanks to the help of actor Sonu Sood
Sonu also provides financial assistance to victims of acid attacks.
He has been receiving treatment and helping his family.
Moreover, he also helps the poor in gurdwaras.
Madhu Pal, a journalist covering Bollywood, said, "Sonu Sood always behaves in a simple manner.
If there are journalists and photographers outside his house, he invites them home.
He also invites journalists standing under the house to cover Ganeshotsav.
His nature has always remained the same."
Why are the tweets of Sonu's Twitter account being deleted?
If anyone wants to return home from outside the state, that person tweets Sonu Sood.
Seeing the tweet, Sonu also replies that 'you will be home tomorrow'.
But now it has been revealed that many tweets are missing from Sonu Sood's Twitter handle.
A visit to his Twitter account reveals that many people had tweeted but now they have been deleted.
However, Sonu's reply is the same.
Political debate
Hundreds of laborers have been evacuated even under adverse conditions, prompting allegations that Sonu Sood's help was politically motivated.
Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut has said that Sonu Sood will be seen as the BJP's star campaigner in the elections.
In the Shiv Sena's mouthpiece 'Saamana', Sanjay Raut has raised questions about Sonu's relief work.
Sonu Sood is a good actor.
What he is doing is good.
But there is a possibility of a 'political director' behind it, Raut said.
This is the beginning of a political debate.
Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam on Sanjay Raut's objections to Sonu Sood's work
Has retaliated.
Instead of praising him with a big heart, Shiv Sena is criticizing him.
Nirupam tweeted that there is no need to go to such a low level to hide our failure on the part of migrant workers.
Manesena has also jumped into this controversy.
What did you do beyond writing the headline? This question has been asked by MNS Chitrapat Sena president Ameya Khopkar.
Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Council Pravin Darekar said that Shiv Sena's criticism is an attempt to stay in the discussion.
Sonu Sood had met Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari a few days back.
After the criticism from 'Samana', Sonu also met Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray.
Sonu also mentioned this in one of her tweets.
Many people delete a tweet by requesting a tweet.
Therefore, it is estimated that many people's tweets are fake, Sonu said in her tweet.
Sonu's political affiliation
In 2018, the then Forest Minister and BJP leader Sudhir Munganti had attended one of its events.
Sonu Sood was present at the Guardian Minister's Cup prize giving ceremony at Chandrapur.
He handed out prizes to the winners.
Sonu had also met Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh a few days back.
He tweeted his photos.
But according to reporters covering Bollywood, Sonu Sood was never interested in politics
I don't think Sonu Sood will go into politics.
He has no political affiliation with anyone.
Even if he gets offers, I don't think Sonu will accept.
He is satisfied as an actor, journalist Parag Chhapekar told BBC Marathi.
Bollywood journalist Pooja Samant thinks that there is a politics behind this.
Speaking to BBC Marathi, she said, "Sonu's work is appreciated.
But we can't say what the political threads may be behind the scenes.
But the Shiv Sena's criticism of Sonu Sood cannot be ruled out.
Even though Sonu Sood has done independently what he did not get despite being the Shiv Sena's chief minister, the Shiv Sena may have a problem.
Political controversy is likely to start as he is getting all the credit, said Pooja Samant.
Sonu Sood's name in Cobra Post's sting
During the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Cobra Post claimed to have 'exposed' some celebrities.
It also had gold interest.
At that time, Sonu Sood was also the goodwill ambassador of the Modi government's 'HumFitTohIndiaFit' campaign.
At the time, Sonu Sood was reportedly ready to post on social media handles that the BJP would benefit, according to a report in the Cobra Post.
Attempts are being made to misinterpret it by cutting it out in editing. "
Corona virus: What are the symptoms of Covid-19 in children?
The second wave of Covid 19 also increased the risk of coronavirus infection in young children.
Symptoms appear in children during this wave of infection.
During the first wave of corona virus, the incidence of covid-19 in young children or adolescents was low.
But during the second wave, the number of patients under the age of 18 seems to have increased.
Experts say that the new strains of the corona virus, the declining number of patients, the children being out of the house to play, the offices started by the adults in the house and the resulting travel are the reasons behind this number of patients.
What are the symptoms of corona virus in children?
In addition to the usual fever and sore throat, children with corona virus have other symptoms.
Pediatricians say that these symptoms are similar to the usual stomach upset and vomiting in children.
So keep in mind that if a child has a stomach upset or pain, vomiting can also be associated with corona.
If children who are unable to speak are constantly irritated, crying uncontrollably, or suffering, this may be a sign of pain in their limbs.
Consulting Pediatrician of Bombay Hospital Dr. Mukesh Sankalecha has a study on infectious diseases in children.
Talking to BBC Marathi about the symptoms found in children, Dr. "Children are more likely to be infected with the corona by their parents or family members.
Most of the children have mild symptoms.
Some have been diagnosed with high fever.
Children will not be able to tell if the taste in the mouth has gone or the smell has stopped.
But a sudden loss of appetite for children may be a sign that they are eating less.
But children recover quickly.
Young children are not allowed to be admitted to the ICU like adults. "
Common symptoms
Heat
Dry cough, sore throat
Shortness of breath
Taste in the mouth, stop smelling
Different symptoms found in young children in the second wave
Stomach upset
Vomiting
Headache
Fainting
Persistent irritability, harassment (even in young children)
Acne
Red eyes
Bluish covering of fingernails or toenails.
This is called 'Covid Toes'.
When to test children's covid?
Dr. "If one of the parents is positive, the child is more likely to be positive, because even the youngest children are around the parents, especially the mother.
We focus on testing the adults, because if their health deteriorates, their treatment may need to change," says Sanklecha.
When it comes to young children, most children do not need a separate treatment.
So there is no serious need for their testing.
But often parents also test their children when there are no symptoms so that things can be clear.
Although the test was positive, the children did not need much treatment.
But if a child goes out and plays and goes to a friend's house, their parents are at risk of contracting the corona virus. "
Children's corona test
But if the child shows symptoms, they should be tested.
Precautions to be taken if children have symptoms
If children have a fever, keep them at home.
Do not send to play when the fever subsides.
The fever may be due to climate change, but it may also be a symptom of corona virus infection.
Contact a doctor immediately.
Do not leave the house if children have corona-like symptoms.
Many doctors have once again started consulting through video calls.
Taking a child to a clinic with symptoms of corona can be dangerous for other children.
Go to the clinic only if the doctor calls for a physical examination.
If a child develops a fever or other symptoms, make a neat chart and record it.
Keep records of date, time, fever, SPO2 (blood oxygen level), pulse rate every 7-8 hours, about three times a day (morning - afternoon - night).
If children are moving their hands, check that the pulse oximeter is sitting on their finger properly
Contact your family doctor / pediatrician immediately if the oxygen level on SPO2 is below 94.
If a child is positive, it is difficult to keep them in a room for quarantine.
If there are grandparents in such a house, they are also at risk of getting this infection.
In this case, the grandparents should be confined to one room for this period, they should be quarantined in one room, and the child should be allowed to roam in the house.
If a baby or toddler falls ill, one of the parents should take care of him.
This can reduce the risk of corona infection spreading to other members of the household.
A parent with a sick baby should wear a mask.
If the sick child is older than 2 years, they should also wear a mask.
Although the incidence of corona symptoms has increased in children, doctors say there is no need to panic as children recover faster.
What if the breastfeeding mother is positive?
This can be decided by talking to your baby's doctor.
But if the woman has mild symptoms, she can wear a mask and breastfeed.
If your baby is younger than 6 months, ask your doctor if it can be quarantined with the mother.
This is because when the mother breastfeeds the baby and gives it back to the grandparents or other family members outside the room, the infection is more likely to spread among the seniors in the house.
Dr. Mukesh Sankalecha says, "Breastfeeding should be continued even after the mother is positive.
And the nutritional benefits of breastfeeding are many times greater than this small risk."
Take this precaution:
External massage to massage small babies can be a means of infection.
Therefore, on the advice of a doctor, massage the baby at home for some time.
Keep baby soap, combs and other things separate.
Wash hands before feeding, feeding, or changing baby clothes.
If using a car, sanitize the car from time to time.
Sanitize children's toys.
Ask the children to sing 'Happy Birthday' twice while washing their hands so that they have enough time to wash their hands.
Do not give multivitamin medications or protein powders directly to children.
Start supplements on the advice of a doctor.
This is because the amount of medication varies according to the age and weight of the child. E.g. Doctors determine a child's daily intake of zinc or vitamin-C based on his / her age and weight.
What is MIS-C?
MIS-C stands for Multi-Inflammatory Syndrome in Kids.
Mumbai-based pediatrician Dr. Gitanjali Shah says, "Symptoms of this syndrome appear in young children 2 to 4 weeks after the onset of covid 19.
These children have antibodies to covid in their body and this condition occurs due to over-activation of their immune system.
This story is very rare so parents do not have to panic.
But they should know about it.
It is important to remember that this can happen.
So don't go for less that your full potential. "
These include inflammation of vital organs in children, stomach upset, abdominal pain, vomiting, acne, red eyes, fever, and redness of the tongue and throat.
It can affect the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, eyes, skin, stomach and intestines.
These symptoms are similar to those found in children with Kawasaki syndrome.
Kawasaki syndrome is found in children under 5 years of age.
MIS-C needs immediate treatment.
For this, if the child has these symptoms, it is necessary to tell the doctor whether he has got covid in the past.
If the child's covid has not been tested, give the doctor an idea of ​​if anyone in the household has had a covid positive some time ago and as a result the child is also likely to be asymptomatic during this period.
If the symptoms in the child are not related to any other disorder, the child may have been diagnosed with covidosis by an antibody test.
Dr. "A few months ago, we had a 12-year-old boy who was admitted to the hospital.
In those previous months, he did not have any problems.
He had to be admitted.
We checked his covid antibodies but he had a lot of antibodies in his body.
Such symptoms require immediate treatment.
Otherwise, it can lead to heart failure and can be fatal. "
Various drug companies around the world have started testing vaccines for this age group.
During the tests, the vaccine proved to be 100 percent effective for the 12- to 15-year-olds, and Pfizer said at the end of March that it had a good immune system.
The test was performed on 2,260 children in the United States. Pfizer - Bioentech vaccine will now be tested on children under 12 years of age.
AstraZeneca has also announced that it will conduct vaccine tests in the UK between the ages of 6 and 17.
Corona virus: What are the symptoms? How to protect from Covid-19?
There are three main symptoms of corona virus.
Even if one of these starts to bother, testing is necessary.
The second wave of corona virus is seen in many places around the world.
Therefore, it is necessary to immediately identify and test the symptoms of corona virus.
What are the symptoms of corona virus?
Non-stop cough - Sometimes this cough can last for more than an hour.
Or a cough may occur three or more times in 24 hours.
Fever - Body temperature 37.8C is higher than 100.4F
Changing the taste in the mouth , the ability to smell - your mouth tastes completely gone, things don't smell.
Or it may seem different.
According to a recent survey by the ONS, people who are infected with the new variant of the Corona experience more severe coughing and sore throat, fatigue and muscle aches than those who are infected with the older variant.
It is important to get tested as soon as any of these symptoms appear.
Also do not leave the house for any reason until the test report is received.
It is advisable for your family or roommates to stay home until the test results are available.
According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), colds, nausea, muscle aches, and sore throats can also be symptoms of corona virus infection.
It takes about 5 days from the onset of infection to the onset of symptoms.
But sometimes it can be up to 14 days, according to the World Health Organization.
If your test is positive, the person should stay in isolation and consult a doctor for further procedures.
Others in the household also need to be quarantined.
Here's what to look for and tactics to help ease the way .
How to measure corona virus fever

This is called 'Covid Toes'.
Read on for more information - What are the symptoms of Covid-19 in children? What is MIS-C?
What to do if covid test is positive?
If the covid test is positive, your lab informs you as well as the health system.
After receiving this information, the local health system or the municipality will contact you.
But until then, it is important that you stay in isolation.
The family of a positive person should also be quarantined.
If the symptoms of a positive person are mild and there are no other disorders, they can stay at home for 10 days in isolation as advised by the doctor and the health system.
Medication should be taken at home on the advice of a doctor.
Corona caution
Other members of the household should not leave the house to stay away from others for 10 days.
Here you can read about what to look for in a home isolation or home quarantine .
If you have mild symptoms, you may feel better by taking a medicine like paracetamol, taking plenty of rest and fluids.
But for this, you should not go out to go to the General Practitioner - Family Doctor or Chemist.
The doctor can give you advice over the phone.
But if the positive person has moderate or severe symptoms, they will be admitted to the covid center or hospital as per the advice of the health system.
When should people go to the hospital?
Most people infected with the corona virus have been cured of body aches, colds and fevers with paracetamol.
But, when breathing becomes difficult, the level of oxygen in the body decreases, then you should go to the hospital immediately.
The doctor then takes an X-ray of the patient's chest to see how much phlegm has accumulated in the chest.
It is then decided whether to supply the patient with oxygen or to place him directly on the ventilator.
If you have difficulty breathing, call the National Helpline number for Covid-19 immediately.
Or you can call 1075.
Also, the pathology report revealed that the corona was obstructed.
What do you do if you have symptoms of corona virus?
What exactly happens in the ICU?
Extremely critically ill patients are treated in the ICU.
Patients with corona get oxygen through oxygen masks.
If it is not possible for the patient, a tube is also delivered to the nose.
If a patient's condition worsens, he is placed on a ventilator in the ICU.
A tube is inserted directly into the body through the nose or mouth.
A large amount of oxygen is delivered directly to the lungs through this tube.
You will find detailed information about the ventilator in the next news.
What are ventilators? Why are they so important in the battle of Corona?
How to protect from corona?
Recent research has shown that the corona virus is spread through small drops that come out of a cough or sneeze, or when a hand touches the area where the drops fall, touching the nose and mouth.
Also, experts have repeatedly said that the risk of such an infection is high in crowded places.
To prevent corona infection, do the following regularly -
Don't go too close to sick people.
Do not touch mouth, nose, eyes, ears without washing hands.
Use tissue paper when sneezing and coughing.
Wash hands regularly with soap.
The WHO has yet to say for sure whether the use of masks can actually prevent corona.
But if you are going to a crowded place then definitely use it.
Older people or people with pre-existing respiratory asthma, diabetes and heart disease are more likely to become seriously ill if they are infected with the corona virus.
Treatment of such patients helps them to breathe and tries to boost the body's immunity.
Corona virus vaccines are now available in many countries.
If you come in contact with an infected person, you should be separated from others for a few days.
Such people should also avoid going out of the house for doctors or medicines.
Inform the local health care officer or municipal staff after you have any symptoms.
If you are positive, you need to have a contact tracing of who came in contact with you.
If symptoms appear, do not wait until the report is received.
Vaccination campaigns are underway in many countries of the world, including India, to curb the global outbreak of Covid 19.
Information about this vaccine, from time to time, may confuse you.
So here are some important things that can help you understand how a vaccine works.
What is a vaccine?
Vaccines teach your body how to fight an illness or a viral infection.
A vaccine is made using a weak or inactive fraction of a virus that causes a disease.
This allows the immune system to recognize the virus that has entered the body and to make antibodies to fight it.
Very few people have the negative or side effects of the vaccine, while some people have the side effects of the vaccine.
Many get a slight fever or rash after being vaccinated.
Vaccines teach your body how to fight an illness or a viral infection.
Immediately after the injection, your body begins to develop an immune system to fight the disease.
Medications treat the disease.
But the vaccine is more effective because it prevents the spread of a disease, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Is the vaccine safe?
Researchers in China discovered the early stage vaccine in the 10th century.
But in 1796, during the company of the goddess, Edward Jenner made a great discovery.
There is a dose of mild infection of the goddess, they found that it protects the goddess from serious infections.
He did research on it, tested his own theories And two years later, their findings were published.
The word vaccine was born at the same time.
It is related to the Latin word Vacca meaning cow.
Vaccines are considered an important discovery in modern medicine.
The World Health Organization estimates that the vaccine kills between two and three million people each year.
The CDC said that the vaccine was being thoroughly tested before it was brought to the market.
It is first tested in a laboratory and then in animals.
This was followed by a human trial of the vaccine.
The disease of the Goddess, which has claimed the lives of millions around the world, has now been eradicated from the world.
The disease of the Goddess, which has claimed the lives of millions around the world, has now been eradicated from the world.
In most countries, vaccinations are started after permission from local drug regulators.
Like other drugs, vaccines carry some risks.
But given the benefits, the risks are small.
For instance, a generation has been vaccinated against the common diseases of childhood.
The disease of the Goddess, which has claimed the lives of millions around the world, has now been eradicated from the world.
But it takes decades to succeed.
Africa was declared polio-free 30 years after vaccination began.
But this period is too long.
Experts warn that it will take months or even years for adequate vaccinations for Covid 19 to occur worldwide, after which life may return to normal.
How are vaccines made?
When a new pathogen, such as a bacterium, virus, parasite or fungus, enters the body, it is called a sub-part of the body, the antigen.
And to fight it, the body begins to make antibodies.
Vaccines contain some weak or inactive components of a bacterium that causes disease.
The vaccine helps to identify the virus that is attacking the body's immune system.
And the body makes antibodies to prevent this attack from outside.
And the body develops immunity against that disease.
New methods are now being used to develop vaccines.
Some of the vaccines on the corona have been developed with similar new methods.
Comparison of covid 19 vaccines
Pfizer - Bioentech and Modern's Covid vaccine are both Messenger RNA vaccines.
A portion of the virus's genetic code is used to create this.
Instead of using the weak or inactive part of the antigen, the vaccine teaches the body how to make the spike protein found on the surface of the virus that causes covid 19.
Covid vaccine comparison
The Oxford and AstraZeneca vaccines are different.
In India it is available under the name Kovishield.
To make this vaccine, some changes were made to a virus that infected chimpanzees, and a part of the genetic code of the corona virus was added to it.
All three vaccines have been approved for use in emergencies by some countries around the world, including the United States and Britain.
What other vaccines are there?
Chinese drug company Synovac has developed a vaccine called 'Coronovac'.
The vaccine is available in China, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines.
The vaccine has been developed in the traditional way using the inactive part of the virus.
But questions have been raised about how effective the vaccine is.
The vaccine was tested in Turkey, Indonesia and Brazil.
Researchers had said that the vaccine was only 50.4 percent effective.
Two vaccines have been developed in India.
Oxford - AstraZeneca vaccine is available in India under the name Covishield.
The vaccine is produced by the Serum Institute of India in Pune.
The second vaccine is a covacin made by an Indian company called Bharat Biotech.
Russia has developed its own vaccine called Sputnik-5.
The vaccine was developed by modifying the virus.
The same vaccine is used in Argentina.
Argentina has ordered 3 million doses of the vaccine for their vaccination.
The African Union has also ordered millions of doses of the vaccine.
Pfizer, AstraZeneca (via the Serum Institute) and Johnson & Johnson have been ordered to vaccinate.
Should I get vaccinated?
Vaccination for Covid 19 is not mandatory.
But it is recommended that as many people as possible get the vaccine.
Exceptions are made for people with health problems.
The CDC says the vaccine will protect not only you but others from covid 19.
Moreover, it is an effective way to curb global warming.
The World Health Organization (WHO) says at least 65 to 70 percent of the world's population needs to be vaccinated to control the disease.
This means that more people need to be motivated to get vaccinated.
But the speed with which the vaccine for Covid 19 has been developed has raised doubts in the minds of many.
While it would take ERV researchers several years to develop a vaccine, this research has been accelerated to find a solution to the coronary artery.
The World Health Organization is working with researchers, companies and health organizations from around the world.
In short, after the vaccination of billions of people, the infection of Covid 19 will stop and the world's herd immunity will increase.
Experts say that this is the way life in the world can be restored.
Corona vaccine: Why is there a gap of 6 to 8 weeks between two doses?
In India, the Covid-19 vaccine is currently given to citizens over 45 years of age.
About 8.7 crore people have been given the first dose of the vaccine so far, according to government figures.
It was earlier decided that there should be an interval of 4 to 6 weeks between the two doses of Covishield vaccine.
But scientific research has shown that the difference between the two doses of covshield vaccine has been increased to six to eight weeks.
This time limit is for covachield only, not for covacin.
But one question is many, why do I have to wait a few days to get another dose?
Before finding the answer to this question, let's find out how vaccines provide protection.
After taking the first dose of the vaccine, it takes a few days for the body to produce antibodies.
Antibodies are slowly formed after the first dose.
It is the body's primary immune system.
But after the second dose, which is called a booster dose, your immune system works faster.
There are also some side effects.
This is a sign that the vaccine is working.
After taking the second dose, not only do antibodies build up in the body, but the body stimulates the lymph nodes as well as other organs to respond.
In many countries, the difference between the two doses is two to three months.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended a two-and-a-half month interval between two doses of covshield vaccine.
There is a debate in many countries as to whether this gap should be short or long.
The British Medical Association says that there should be a gap of 6 weeks between the two doses of Pfizer vaccine, not 12 weeks.
In February, the medical journal The Lancet reported that the Covishield vaccine, produced by the Serum Institute in Pune, is 55.1% effective if the two doses are less than 6 weeks apart, and 81.3% if two doses are given 12 weeks apart. Was found.
In India, the gap is now 6 to 8 weeks.
What is the reason for this? How much of a difference can there be between two doses of vaccine?
Can corona be infected after taking the first dose of vaccine?
The possibility of this cannot be ruled out and therefore you should continue to carefully follow all the instructions given to prevent infection.
Use of masks, social distance etc.
Infection can occur even after a second dose of the vaccine, but it is extremely mild and less likely to be hospitalized.
A second dose is needed because many vaccines work at full capacity only after a booster dose.
Take the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine.
The vaccine is given to children to prevent measles and mumps.
There are two doses of this vaccine.
Statistics show that only 40 percent of children who take the first dose are not protected from these three viruses.
But only 4 percent of children who take both doses are at risk.
This also shows that no vaccine is 100% effective.
After taking the second dose, you are safer than people who have not been vaccinated or who have taken only one dose.
Therefore, it is important to complete the vaccine dose.
Which vaccines are given in India?
Both the Oxford-AstraZeneca covshield vaccine manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and the all-India covacin vaccine manufactured by Bharat Biotech have been approved by the Comptroller General of Drugs of India.
Will the first dose of one vaccine and the second dose of the second vaccine work?
This is a question for many. For example, will it work if I take the first dose of Covishield and the second dose of Covacin?
So it cannot be done in India.
It is mandatory to take both doses of the same vaccine.
But research is underway in the UK to study the effects of two doses of two different vaccines on the effectiveness and protection of an individual.
But at the moment, I have been told to take both doses of the same vaccine.
How long is the protection after vaccination?
Covid's vaccines were completed a few months ago, so this question cannot be answered right now.
Research is ongoing.
Current information suggests that antibodies in the body of a person infected with covid protects them from re-infection for some time, but no concrete information is available on how long this will last.
Are covid vaccines effective?
No vaccine is 100 percent effective, and covid vaccines are no exception.
As a result, some people may not develop immunity to the vaccine.
But covid vaccines are said to be very effective.
The vaccine is claimed to be 81 percent effective.
So what is the need to get vaccinated?
The Government of India has not made vaccination mandatory.
It is up to you to decide whether or not to get vaccinated.
Vaccines approved for vaccination are said to reduce the risk of infection.
It also makes you less likely to infect others.
Read this again on the go and remember that even after taking the first dose of the vaccine, all precautions need to be taken.
Do not assume that you are completely safe from infection even after taking the second dose.
Corona vaccine: Halfkin year-round vaccine production effort - Dr. Sandeep Rathore
Corona's havoc in Maharashtra is increasing day by day.
Experts believe that vaccination is an important measure to control the rapid spread of coronavirus across the country.
Following the demand of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, the Center has given permission to the Halfkin Institute to manufacture Covacin vaccine on a transfer basis from Bharat Biotech.
Secretary, Department of Science and Technology, Central Government, Dr. Renu Swaroop has written a letter to Chief Secretary Sitaram Kunte informing about this.
How will covacin be produced in Halfkin Biopharma? How long is it likely to take? The BBC quoted Huffkin Biopharma's managing director, Dr. Discussed with Sandeep Rathore.
It is estimated that it will take at least a year for the vaccine to be developed.
But, with all the necessary permissions, we are trying to produce the vaccine within a year by signing a memorandum of understanding with Bharat Biotech as soon as possible.
We have received permission from the Department of Biotechnology under the Covid Security Scheme of the Central Government.
Q. How many vaccines will be made per year in Halfkin?
We have the capacity to produce 22.8 million doses a year once vaccine production begins in Halfkin.
The vaccine will be manufactured at Halfkin Biotech's Parel headquarters.
It is yet to be decided how many doses the state will get and how much will be given to other states once vaccine production starts.
This is an ambitious project.
There will be an internal team for this.
A technical team will be formed.
Vaccine production has two stages.
The raw material for vaccination and filling in the bottle after vaccination.
Security is very important for this.
Safety requires a three-level lab.
The raw material for the vaccine will be prepared in a ready BSL-3 lab. 
It will take six to eight months to build.
 This lab has to be built using very high quality technology.
 For this, we will take the help of scientists and technology experts.
Is safety important to keep the quality of the vaccine good?
Once the vaccine is prepared, it will be validated. 
The safety of the vaccine is paramount.
Special attention will be paid to safety at various stages to maintain the quality of the vaccine. 
This will be checked by experts from time to time.
Will Halfkin's vaccine be affordable?
As Halfkin Biopharma is a public sector unit, our vaccines are available at affordable prices. 
This vaccine will not be expensive.
This will be of great benefit to the state once the vaccine is manufactured.
Corona Maharashtra: Government announces help to tribals, but what happened to last year's financial aid?
On 13 April 2021, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, while addressing the people, again announced the lockdown.
While the lockdown was taking place, the government announced a Rs 5,400 crore aid package for the needy.
Rs 1500 will be provided to rickshaw pullers, registered peddlers and laborers.
Wheat and rice will be provided free of cost under the Food Security Act.
Besides, Rs. 2000 will be provided to 12 lakh tribals under Khawati scheme.
Opposition groups called for the beleagured PM to resign.
It was decided to give Rs. 4000 to the tribals under Khawati scheme.
But there are many complaints that last year's help has not yet been received.
This report presents the government's announcements, announced plans and the current situation.
'I heard that I will get help, but ...'
There are 7-8 people living in the house.
We are husband and wife, our old mother and five children ... We used to get up in the morning and work in the fields.
I had to go to sleep, said Chander Balu from Saparunga village in Wada taluka.
The grasses of the Katkari community are agricultural laborers.
I don't get a month's salary like the people in the city.
I used to postpone my daily routine.
I drank water for several days in a month in the back lockdown.
There was no food particle in the house.
Wheat and rice are available on ration.
But where will you get other spices to cook it?
Last time, it was heard that the government would pay Rs 4,000.
But nothing was found.
Now back to work.
The government has said it will help.
We don't get any help.
How many days do you want to starve? "
The situation of Surekha Pawar from the same village is worse than that of the grass family.
Surekha has a six-month-old son.
Before giving birth, Surekha and her husband used to work in the fields.
But now that there is no work, his family is struggling to make ends meet.
Says Surekha, "Sometimes I go to catch fish except for Pora.
If I get it, I sell it and get paid for that day.
If my mother-in-law gets a job in the laundry one day,
she gets Rs 100-150.
We do not have a ration card.
So there is no grain.
Last time, when the government closed everything, the ration card was removed.
But it was not sealed.
There is no money to go to the taluka for that.
The villagers were saying that they would get Rs 4,000 at the last closing time.
But some four thousand have not been seen to date.
We hear everything.
Nothing falls into place. "
What is Khawti Yojana?
The loan scheme was launched by the state government in 1978 for the economically disadvantaged tribals.
The scheme provided assistance to the tribals from the state government.
However, in 2013-14, the scheme was closed.
During the Corona period last year, the employment of tribals engaged in agricultural labor ceased.
The decision to provide financial assistance to them was taken by the state government at a cabinet meeting.
A ruling in this regard was issued on 9 September 2020.
As per the decision, the government agreed to provide Rs 2,000 in cash and Rs 2,000 worth of groceries like Matki, Chawli, Gram, Pea, Uraddal, Turdal, Sugar, Peanut Oil, Salt, Tea, Spices to the tribals under the Khawati scheme.
'Give back first, then speak now'
In the last lockdown, many organizations started agitation demanding help for tribal and Katkari families.
The support went to the labor union in the High Court.
Vivek Pandit, president of the Samarth Shramjivi Sanghatana and a tribal leader, said, "The government had agreed in the High Court on May 15, 2020 to provide foodgrains and other materials.
He decided to give Rs 2,000 in cash and Rs 2,000 in materials.
The ruling was issued in September.
But it was not until December that all this process was completed.
Many families were migrating then.
So how to deliver the material?
But since then, the government has taken no action.
So give it a go before you make a new announcement and then make a new announcement. "
Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis also told the media that the government's package was "dust-throwing".
He said, "The grant of Rs 2,000 announced in the Khawati scheme is going to wipe the mouths of the tribals.
Last year, the finance secretary had asked for it.
But the ministers did not give it as they wanted to buy materials.
Last year's Rs 4,000 grant has not been received yet."
Last year's Rs 482 crore will be distributed in two days
We sought the government's response to the opposition's allegations.
Why haven't the previous year's money been paid yet?
Will the same money be distributed or will tribals be paid as per the new package?
In this regard, we asked the state's Tribal Development Minister K. C. Asked Padvi.
He told BBC Marathi, "For a long time last year, a survey was conducted of the tribals living under this scheme.
There were some technical issues.
We have held review meetings in this regard in the last two days.
Now the technical issues have almost been resolved.
Therefore, in the next two-three days, 7 lakh tribal families will be given a cash grant of Rs.
The government will disburse the grant of Rs 482 crore.
The Rs 2,000 announced by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray.
There is also provision for that money.
They will be categorized according to need. "
Corona: How do you explain to children about infections, immunity, vaccines?
Does your hand hurt when you get vaccinated?
Yeah ... a little ...
Then why do you get vaccinated? I don't like ... pierced ...
This question of a six-year-old boy, everyone is asking.
Children in your home may have similar questions, so I try to answer them in simple terms.
What is an infection?
There are two types of cells in the blood.
Red cells and white cells.
These white blood cells are the protective forces of our body.
A very clever organization that has assimilated all the guerrilla warfare like Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's Mavals!
Some of these cells are trapped in all parts of the body and are called "antigen presenting cells" (cells that stimulate the blood to produce antibodies).
The whole body is surrounded by skin.
If a germ (bacteria / virus / any other) accidentally penetrates through this wall, it cannot escape the gaze of these mammals.
Their first purpose is to catch him.
The cells capture and kill the germs and carry them directly to the commander.
These "lymph nodes" are called lymph nodes because there are different camps for these soldiers coming from each area.
(Fever, sore throat, lumps in the throat are the same!) Here the soldiers who bring germs meet the commander called "T cell".
They investigate the brought prisoner.
Is it dangerous?
What kind of power does he have?
What weapons?
This is how it is thoroughly scrutinized.
And all this information is given to the army.
In the army of "T cell" there is a special soldier called "B cell" who has the skill to make various weapons "customized" to suit every enemy.
Using this power, this weapon is the five types of "antibodies" (IgM, IgG, IgA, IgE and IgD) (the same ones that are tested in the lab!).
These five types of weapons have very specific functions.
If the enemy in front has a sword in his hand, then you have to have a shield in your hand, the tigers are useless there !!
The B cell is the weapon that makes up the bulk.
Another important task is to keep the enemy in good memory.
It's like taking a photo of the enemy and putting up a poster of "Wanted" all over the village to keep all the soldiers alert!
The next time the same enemy comes again, he does not panic!
These 'T cells' and 'B cells' combine to fight the forces at the very front, the "phagocyte" (a type of white blood cell that destroys microorganisms that enter the body) and literally devour the germ.
Such an encounter with any type of germ is called an infection.
What is immunity?
All of the above processes are constantly going on in our body because we are constantly exposed to one or another germ.
This power is innately inherited from our parents.
But she is born naive.
As we get older and more and more germs are exposed, these cells are formed.
And this fighting force keeps getting bigger and stronger.
This army, formed from birth in the mother's body, lends some weapons to the newborn baby.
In the process of a little birth and a little milk.
Breast milk contains natural immune-boosting ingredients.
When this army is ready, if an enemy enters through the coast, antibodies capture it and eat the phagocytes.
And even if there is an infection, there are no symptoms, or you are not bothered.
What is a vaccine?
Simply put, a vaccine is a dead germ! The dead / disarmed / depleted germ is injected into the body and realizing that the enemy has indeed arrived, our protective army is ready, armed with all the above processes.
That is, when a real enemy comes, he is killed before he can injure the body.
We have the gift of a brilliant scientist named Edward Jenner.
Vaccines are of many types, killed (killed germs), inactivated (deactivated germs), live attenuated (living germs that have been removed), subunit (only germ remnants).
How does the vaccine work ?
The same process as described above takes place in the body after vaccination.
All of these do not have a magic wand, so it takes four to six weeks for antibodies to form after a single dose.
After taking the next dose, it takes another three to four months.
The germs never come alone, they also have an army, the distance between two doses and the time after the last dose is very important to produce enough antibodies to fight that whole army.
This is called 'Siro Conversion'.
Sometimes, after many years of taking the dose, both the capacity and the level of antibodies produced are reduced, so vaccines like tetanus and typhoid need to be taken more frequently.
Just as our army is clever, sometimes the germs are twice as smart, changing their form, changing their weapons and tactics.
New mutations are needed every year for such mutations.
The flu virus is this type of germ.
Fever and body aches occur after taking the dose as the vaccine is also a type of infection.
It is a kind of acknowledgment that the body's fighting cells are ready to fight back.
Immunity is a natural strength given to everyone.
It cannot grow or strengthen overnight by taking any extract, turmeric-milk medicine or powder.
Proper square diet, adequate exercise, proper incorporation of micronutrients i.e. vitamins and minerals and positive attitude have benefits if included in the lifestyle for a long period of time (two days, not four weeks).
No matter how powerful this body structure is, it has limitations.
Avoiding exposure is the best way to treat epidemics.
Following the current corona outbreak, frequent hand washing with soap and sanitizer (corona virus is 'enveloped').
In soap and sanitizer, the shell dissolves and the germs die, not alone but there are many viruses), masks (on the nose).
Vaccine Preventable Diseases is a sure cure for diseases that can be controlled by taking a dose, so do not miss this dose.
In the end, it is true that "the living son of man is dependent".
We have a big hand in keeping our children healthy in the future.
To date, this world-changing technology has overcome incurable and chronic diseases, such as polio, measles, mumps, measles, mumps, rubella, and so on.
It is unknown at this time what he will do after leaving the post.
But the vaccine is a ray of hope.
These "armor coils" created by the brilliant scientists of the last century will surely be a gift to the next generation as well!
Pankaja Munde-Dhananjay Munde tweet over corona vaccine
In Maharashtra, on the one hand, the prevalence of corona vaccine is increasing rapidly, on the other hand, the shortage of corona vaccine is also increasing rapidly and political allegations against these issues are also increasing.
The latest allegations by the Munde brothers and sisters in Beed have now sparked controversy.
It started with BJP MP from Beed Dr. Performed by Pritam Munde.
Dr. In a tweet, Munde addressed Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and the Health Minister, saying, "Out of the 2 lakh vaccines received from the Center for the state, only 20 vaccines were distributed to Beed.
This is reprehensible.
We must rectify this imbalance."
From the same tweet, Dr. Pritam Munde also targeted Dhananjay Munde without naming him.
Dr. After this tweet of Pritam Munde, Dhananjay Munde has done a few tweets one after another.
In his very first tweet, Dhananjay Munde said, "After months of rest, I woke up suddenly and didn't know much about the outside world.
The 2 lakh vaccines given to the state by the Center are for the second dose of covacin.
Will not be. "
In particular, Dr. Dhananjay Munde. This tweet has also been tagged on Pratim Munde's Twitter handle.
Therefore, Dhananjay Munde directly asked Dr. It is clear that these answers were given to Pratim Munde.
Dr. Dhananjay Munde replied to a total of 6 tweets. Given to Pritam Munde.
In one of the tweets, Dhananjay Munde said, "Instead of writing a letter to Tai Saheb, Hon'ble Chief Minister and Hon'ble Health Minister, send a letter to Hon'ble Prime Minister with full information and insist on increasing the supply of vaccines so that we can really help in this fight against Corona!"
Furthermore, in a recent tweet, Dhananjay Munde tweeted a photo of the vaccine statistics table, saying, "We are giving you detailed statistics of the remaining 2 lakh vaccines received and required with the distribution of the newly acquired vaccine vaccine!
Jalna-Solapur is zero in the list of 20 vaccines you have shared.
Shouldn't we have the simple question of getting a vaccine in our own district? "
Tweetwar' is only for Beed MP Dr. It is not limited to Pritam Munde and Dhananjay Munde, the Guardian Minister of Beed.
Because BJP leader and former Women and Child Development Minister Pankaja Munde has also jumped into the controversy.
Pankaja Munde's sister Dr. Pritam rushed to Munde's aid.
He tweeted a screenshot of Dhananjay Munde's tweet saying, "For the good of the state, I will write this letter to the PM, the CM of the district and Pawar Saheb!
Do the old fund work, inaugurate it, you have the right, brother! "
Overall, there has been a good 'tweet war' among the Munde brothers and sisters over the supply of corona vaccine in Beed.
Why was Uddhav Thackeray humiliated to lockdown again in Maharashtra?
All viruses mutate, altering their own structure.
This process is done by them to survive in adverse conditions as well as to increase fertility.
The survival of the corona virus is forcing him to change himself.
But this struggle to change oneself is not seen in any government in India or in the people.
Otherwise, it would not have been a disgrace to impose lockdown for the second time in a year in Maharashtra.
Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has imposed a 15-day lockdown in the state from 8 pm on April 14 due to rising corona infection in Maharashtra.
Even while announcing this, Uddhav Thackeray did not call it a lockdown.
But it's a little more than a curfew and a little less than a lockdown.
In March last year, a nationwide lockdown was announced just hours before the announcement.
This was opposed by many political parties at that time.
The Maharashtra government was also involved.
He was backed by the central government and several doctors in the country, saying the lockdown was justified.
This, he argued, would break the chain of infection and give enough time to equip health facilities.
But a year later, the state chief minister is once again announcing a lockdown for 'Break the Chain'.
So the question arises as to why this time has come.
The question is whether we have not learned anything in one year.
Even after last year’s lockdown, there was no preparation to address the drug shortage.
What happened to the hospitals that were built during this period, ventilators were purchased, ICU beds were increased in one year?
To take stock of how much the situation has changed in the state in the last one year, the BBC has asked the Indian Medical Association's Maharashtra division's 2020 president, Dr. Interacted with Avinash Bhondwe.
According to him, whatever the government did last year.
It seems that the government has forgotten to learn from it or the people have forgotten it.
The remaining debris was filled by further disruptive planning.
He says, "People are disconnected from wearing masks, washing their hands and observing social distance.
Fever is ignored.
As a result, people are admitted to the hospital late.
Dr. Bhondwe raised a number of issues one after the other.
He said that it is necessary to learn a lesson from the following topics.
The points made by Bhondwe are as follows -
Lesson 1: Provision of Funds in Health Sector
Expenditure on health facilities in Maharashtra is only 0.5 per cent per annum.
It increased after the Covid-19 outbreak.
However, its share in the state government's budget did not reach 1 per cent, says Bhondwe.
An increase of Rs 500 crore has been mentioned in this year's budget.
But considering the epidemic, the figure is very low.
The IMA estimates that the health sector should account for at least 5 per cent of the total state budget.
Bhondwe also said that no new government hospital has been started in the state in a year during the outbreak.
Meanwhile, Finance Minister Ajit Pawar, while presenting this year's budget , has allocated Rs 7,500 crore for healthcare.
Lesson 2: There is still a shortage of hospitals, doctors, nurses and technicians
Dr. Bhondwe says, "Government hospitals in Maharashtra have only 10,000 beds.
As a result, most people are waiting for private hospitals.
During the Kovid-19 outbreak, 80 per cent of the burden is borne by private hospitals, while 20 per cent is borne by government hospitals."
The number of government hospitals equipped with all facilities is very low.
The number of hospitals with bypass surgery, cardiology, good operating theaters and ICU facilities is not even measurable.
But the current government is not the only one responsible for this, he explained.
These things have not been taken care of in the state for years.
There are no good government medical colleges or nursing colleges in the state.
The same is true of technicians working in the laboratory, says Bhondwe.
The number of registered doctors in the state is 1 lakh 25 thousand.
But there is a double need for doctors.
Last year, there was a shortage of nurses in the state.
The situation is still the same in Maharashtra.
The state has a 40 per cent shortage of nurses more than required.
This means that government hospitals cannot get even three nurses a day for each shift.
According to the new state law, such a quantity is required.
The situation is further exacerbated by the shortage of lab technicians working in the dialysis center, ICU, ventilator.
All these shortcomings cannot be filled in one year.
The government could not rectify the situation.
Even today, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray is appealing to young doctors and nurses to join him.
Lesson 3: Planning a Trial
Even after a year has passed since Corona came along, people still have to wait a few days for the test results to come out, such complaints are being found on a large scale on social media.
It is now common for tests to take 2-3 days to arrive.
Last year, there were only 60 government and private testing centers in Maharashtra.
Also the number of laboratories was limited.
After one year, the number of test centers increased to 523.
But the number of laboratories did not increase as much as it should have.
The state has been seeing more than 57,000 patients daily since last week.
Although the number of tests per million has increased, it is not enough considering the number of patients per day.
The health secretary of the central government also agreed.
The proportion of RTPCR tests in the total tests is extremely low.
This test is considered extremely important for the corona.
There is no denying that corona proliferation is currently gaining momentum.
In many places whole families are seen to be positive.
In such cases, contact tracing has to be done more.
Tests are also becoming more frequent.
As a result, the load on the testing system is increasing.
Lesson 4: The Most Needed for Oxygen and Medicine
On Tuesday, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said, "There may be a shortage of oxygen in the state in the next few days.
But there may be delays in bringing oxygen from other states by road.
Delays in bringing oxygen from states more than 1,000 km away can be dangerous."
The Air Force should help us in this work.
According to experts, everyone knew that there would be another wave of corona infection.
The Director of Medical Research at Jaslok Hospital, Mumbai, Dr. Rajesh Parekh has written two books on corona, 'The Corona Virus Book' and 'The Vaccine Book'.
He says, "I wrote in my first book about the second and third corona waves.
We need to be prepared for that.
If the first wave sees 30,000 new patients every day in the state, 10 per cent of them would need to be hospitalized.
The state government should have statistics on the need for ICUs, oxygen and ventilators.
The same applies to remedivir.
In the coming wave, the state government had to prepare for 60,000 patients per day.
But we didn't think about it.
In other words, if the planning had been done twice a month after the first wave, the announcement made by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Facebook Live on April 13 would not have been needed.
It was clear from this that the disgrace of lockdown would not have been inflicted on Maharashtra.
Lesson 5: Accelerated Vaccination
Another thing related to future planning is vaccination.
We are producing vaccines for the whole world.
But we are constantly ignoring the situation in our home.
According to experts, a lockdown should be imposed to control the second wave, otherwise the vaccination campaign should be carried out expeditiously.
So far 1 crore citizens have been vaccinated in the state.
Dr. Rajesh says, "The polio and small pox vaccines were delivered door-to-door in India.
Some more measures need to be taken to expedite vaccination in the state.
Otherwise, these restrictions may need to be increased again and again.
Neither the state government nor the Indian government has learned from other countries."
Lesson 6: Migration of Foreign Workers
Dr. Rajesh says, "Last year saw a huge migration of foreign workers.
But the government has not learned anything from it.
Now it is seeing the same pattern for the second time.
A similar picture is emerging from many places in the state.
The state government cannot plan it properly. This shows.
The situation does not improve with the announcement on TV the day before.
Last year, the government had given only four hours.
At this time, the state government gave a period of 24 hours.
In such a short period of time, the situation may get worse.
There is a question of employment for the people who have returned to their respective villages.
The government had to guarantee their employment.
Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has planned to spend Rs 5,476 crore separately for the economically weaker sections as well as for the health sector.
But people should not be fired, rent should not be demanded, so some planning was needed, said Dr. Parekh thinks.
Chapter 7: Jumbo Covid Center closed
In the first wave of corona infection, several temporary jumbo covid centers of 1 to 2 thousand beds were started in India.
In many places the state government gave it to other institutions to run.
However, since September last year, the number of patients has been declining, with 100 or fewer patients being admitted per day.
So this Covid Center was closed.
The contract of the contracted doctor was also canceled.
This was a big mistake of the state government, said Dr. Bhondwe thinks so.
Now the state government will have difficulty in getting doctors again.
He also gave the example of a jumbo covid center in Pune.
The Municipal Corporation stopped paying the electricity bill due to urgency.
But now it's time to start again.
It is clear that the situation would not have been so bad if the government and the people had not forgotten the lessons learned from last year's wave.
Government of Maharashtra
The state government and the central government have often come face to face in handling the cowardly situation.
While the Center has lashed out at the state for a number of issues, including supply of vaccines and shortage of medicines, the state government has blamed the Center for not helping.
Now, when it comes to handling covid, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has claimed that the facilities have been increased in the last one year.
In his inaugural address, he said, "The number of coveted care centers in the state has increased by 1,500 from 2,600 last year.
Last year, there were 3,25,000 lakh beds, but now the number has gone up to 3,50,000."
On the same day, at the Central Government's regular press conference on April 12, Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan blamed the Maharashtra government for the waste of work.
He said, "The average number of patients in Maharashtra in 24 hours is increasing every week.
Now it has gone up to 57,000.
Infection is on the rise, but the rate of RTPCR tests in the state is low. "
In short, the central and state governments are facing each other here.
Even so, the state's health system is really capable of handling Corona's condition and the work she has done so far has been discussed by BBC Marathi with the head of the covid department at Fortis Hospital in Mumbai. Learned from Farah Ingle.
Maharashtra has been hit the hardest by the second wave.
We have to fight on two fronts.
To save the lives of those affected by the corona and to vaccinate people to protect them from the corona.
We have managed the two fronts competently.
Doctors, health workers, the administration, the government and the people of the state are working together to tackle the crisis.
The number of patients recovering every day proves that we are succeeding.
Maharashtra Corona: Read this before going out in the lockdown
Strict restrictions have been imposed in the state for the next fortnight.
However, during this time you will have many doubts about which services will be on and which will be closed.
Here are the answers to 7 such selected questions.
Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had said that some strict restrictions have to be imposed across the state for the next fortnight.
The decision to implement Section 144 across the state has been announced.
The Chief Minister has avoided calling it a lockdown.
He described the "Break the Chain" campaign as "strict restrictions" again.
Article 144, What exactly is a curfew?
What work can we go out for?
You have many such questions in your mind.
Here we will try to answer 7 such important questions.
First of all, these strict restrictions apply from time to time, from 8pm on Wednesday 14th April to 7am on 1st May.
Section 144 will be applicable during this period.
In other words, it can be said that there is a curfew and a curfew in the state.
Section 144 of the Indian Penal Code was enacted in 1973 and may be enforced by the administrative head of a state or a particular province.
According to this section, 4 or more people cannot come together or communicate together during this period.
Violators can face criminal charges.
Essential service movements are excluded.
This clause is used in case of erv communal riots or social outbreaks.
But, now this clause is being used for the second time during a health emergency.
The state government has published a detailed plan of which services and offices can be maintained in the time of these restrictions.
Detailed news based on it is also available on BBC Marathi website.
But even after that, you still have many doubts about it.
And that's what you ask on social media pages.
Let's see the answers to the selected questions now.
1. Can I go out to the grocery store to buy vegetables?
The answer to this is actually given by the Chief Minister himself in his speech.
Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray says, "All the shops providing essential services and food as well as food items will remain open during the period of restrictions."
Shops for food and raw materials are open during this period.
So you can go out and do the market as you need.
Meat and mutton shops will also continue.
However, if you are in a containment zone or if your building is sealed due to more than five corona patients as per the previous rules, the municipal administration will facilitate the delivery of these items to your area.
But, you also have to be careful.
Store a few days of groceries and vegetables at the same time without going out every day.
Don’t forget the mask when you go out.
And avoid eating vegetables during rush hour.
You can also order vegetables and groceries online these days and don't forget that it is allowed.
Can a housemaid helper come home?
This is the current million dollar question.
Unfortunately, the answer is yes only under certain circumstances.
That is, you will guarantee that the person will be brought to your home safely, that is, you will provide 'corona-free' transportation of the person, if your society allows you to do so, and only then you can invite anyone to do the housework.
But the government is also adamant that houseworkers are not getting some essential services.
Can I go out for take away / parcel?
The answer is yes.
Parcel service is allowed to continue from the food vendor on the street to the hotel so as not to inconvenience anyone's meal.
Bakery or tea stalls will also continue.
But, you can't stop there and eat this food.
You have to bring the parcel home.
If there is a valid reason, you can opt out. What is the valid reason?
If you have health problems at home, need help with it, or if you do, that's a valid reason.
All industries related to essential services are in operation, or the rainy season has not stopped.
It is valid if you are going out for such work.
If your company facilitates your transportation, such companies can also work.
If you go out of the house then it will work.
Such people can also work if you are accommodated in the workplace.
Director General of Police Sanjay Pandey has said that the police will not harass you if you go out for urgent work.
Pandey said, "Police will not harass those who go out for urgent work.
However, if they go out without any reason and violate the rules, the police will take action."
Passes are not required for essential traffic.
No more than five people should leave after section 144 comes into force.
Lockdown is for the public, Pandey added.
He further added that if anyone violates the rules, they should not use sticks.
Rely on public transport only?
No. Rickshaws and taxis will also continue during this period.
But there are some rules to follow when traveling.
Fifty percent of the capacity of public buses is seating and standing is not allowed.
The taxi can accommodate two more people besides the driver.
The rickshaw can also accommodate two people including the driver.
You only want to get out if you need to.
Is it possible to move from one district to another district or state?
Yes. If you are traveling for work and you follow the rules of corona, negative covid report and mask, social distance, then there are no restrictions on such travel at present.
Many of you have asked if your train ticket has been issued, then you can go.
But, if there is such a solid reason for it, then we should come out.
Will industry, construction, offices continue?
The answer depends on what industry you work in.
All industries such as food, essential services, health are allowed.
But, there are some restrictions for the construction and manufacturing sector.
You need to prove that your company cares about the health of its employees. T
his means that either the employees have to live in the same colony, from where the company has to make arrangements to bring them directly to the company.
Otherwise the company or office may continue to operate in a place where the company has made complete arrangements for the transportation of employees.
In the construction sector too, if the construction site is fully staffed, it can be continued.
But, for that, employees or laborers will not be able to go out freely.
Even so, owning one is still beyond the reach of the average person.
Some have asked if the liquor store will continue.
No, that's the answer.
How did China's economy grow after the outbreak of the corona virus?
China's GDP has risen sharply in the wake of the Corona outbreak.
In the first quarter of 2021, China's economy grew by 18.3 percent year-on-year.
China has been recording quarterly records since 1992.
This is the highest increase in the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) since then.
According to Reuters, China's economy is expected to grow by 19 percent.
But in reality the growth was a little less than expected.
Last year, China was hit by a major financial crisis.
Compared to him, these numbers seem to be higher.
But the increase is said to be unexpected.
In the first quarter of 2020, a national lockdown was declared in China.
China's economy was hit hard during that period.
At the time, China's GDP had shrunk to 6.8 percent.
The situation in China last year was basically dire.
Therefore, according to the statistics released now, it seems that China has returned.
Industrial production rose 14.1 per cent year-on-year to March.
Retail sales also grew by 34.2 per cent.
China's economy is heavily dependent on exports.
Currently, factories are focusing on orders for overseas products, so the picture above is said to have emerged.
Also, domestic business is slowly growing.
Some experts believe that this will fill the void left by the corona.
Even before the Corona outbreak, the Chinese government was trying to boost the economy.
It was trying to increase the percentage of citizens spending on personal use.
But they succeeded to some extent.
After the Corona outbreak, the problems facing the government increased, he said.
In the last quarter of 2020, China's economic growth rate was 6.5 percent.
These figures also show that China has maintained the same pace.
China's economy slowly picked up speed after the Corona outbreak hit.
Proper planning was done to prevent the spread of the virus, as well as emergency assistance to the industry.
Despite the poor performance in the first quarter of 2020, China's economy continued to grow rapidly.
China was the only economy in the world to record economic growth in 2020.
China, the world's second-largest economy, grew by 2.3 percent in 2020.
This is the lowest number in the last several years.
After the crisis last year, China aims to maintain 6 percent economic growth in 2021.
Corona: Why did Denmark stop giving AstraZeneca vaccine?
Denmark has suspended a vaccine against the Oxford-AstraZeneca corona virus.
Denmark has become the first European country to do so.
The postponement was due to complaints of blood clots forming after receiving the vaccine.
But such complaints are rare, just as important.
Denmark's decision could have an impact on its vaccination campaign.
The European Medicines Agency, which monitors drugs in Europe, said last week that blood clots could be linked to the vaccine.
But the risk of death from Covid-19 is many times greater.
Some countries in Europe have already stopped using the AstraZeneca vaccine for some time.
AstraZeneca vaccination is being implemented in most European countries.
But there are some restrictions on the use of this vaccine in the elderly.
On Tuesday, the United States, Canada and the European Union banned the use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine for similar reasons.
In South Africa, Johnson & Johnson's vaccine use was suspended for the same reason.
The Johnson & Johnson vaccine was effective on the South African variant of the corona virus.
It is a popular vaccine in South Africa.
However, its use was postponed, it is special.
The AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines work the same way.
They are called adenoviral vectors.
Why did Denmark bring a moratorium?
Until further notice, we are withdrawing all 2.4 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, Danish officials said.
According to local health officials, one person in every 40,000 suffers from blood clots.
According to an AFP report, the vaccine was found in two cases of blood clots in Denmark.
It also killed a 60-year-old woman.
The company's director general, Soren Brostrom, commented.
The decision was difficult for the government.
But Denmark has other vaccine options available.
At present, the corona epidemic in the country is under control, he said.
He added, "The risk of covidosis in the country of those who will be vaccinated with corona has been reduced many times over."
Officials have not ruled out the possibility of the AstraZeneca vaccine being used again in the country.
About 1 million people in Denmark have been vaccinated so far.
One and a half million of them have been vaccinated against AstraZeneca.
Vaccines from Pfizer Bioentech and Modern are also being used in Denmark.
Emergency service vehicles to get 'color code' in Mumbai
In Mumbai, caller codes will be issued to vehicles providing essential services during lockdown.
Mumbai Police is trying to reduce the number of vehicles on the roads during the lockdown.
Red color for vehicles of medical staff, medical services
Green for vegetables, groceries, fruits and dairy carts
Yellow for essential service
These will be 6 inch round stickers affixed on these vehicles.
These stickers will be affixed on the front and rear windows of the vehicle.
The stickers will be obtained from the police at some toll plazas and blockades.
The order was issued by Mumbai Police Commissioner Hemant Nagarale himself.
Doctors, ambulances and medical vehicles are getting stuck due to checkpoints at toll plazas.
A color code policy is being introduced for this.
Emergency service people will have to affix stickers on the vehicles, said Hemant Nagarale.
Police, corporations, journalists, doctors, some are taking advantage by putting up posters like this.
Therefore, the Mumbai Police is investigating whether the employees in the vehicles are working for essential services.
We want to carry out the lockdown announced by the Maharashtra government well, said Hemant Nagarale.
On the other hand, Mumbai's Guardian Minister Aslam Sheikh said, "The vegetable market is not overcrowded.
If it is overcrowded, it will be closed in a day or two."
Corona virus statistics: How many corona patients are there in Mumbai, Pune, Maharashtra today?

Corona drugs: How much is the sale of essential drugs on the black market?
Last Thursday, Akhilesh Mishra started getting fever.
They also had a little cough.
They thought it must be the flu.
But after his father - Yogendra Mishra started having the same problem, he started worrying.
Both of them decided to do RT-PCR test for Covid and consult a doctor.
Everywhere he was being given an appointment three days later.
They finally got a Sunday slot at a hospital.
Meanwhile, Yogendra Mishra's health started deteriorating.
Fever rate increased.
The doctor told him to be admitted to the hospital as soon as possible.
But that was the biggest challenge.
Many hospitals in Noida, including the capital Delhi, rejected him.
He was finally admitted to a private hospital in Delhi.
Akhilesh says his father's health has improved.
But for a moment, they were afraid that something bad would happen.
He says, "I was getting depressed.
I thought if something bad happened to them because I didn't get treatment ... the situation I went through shouldn't happen to anyone.
Everyone should get treatment."
But this is not their only story.
Many families in India are currently looking for hospital beds, life-saving medicines or oxygen cylinders.
In some cities in India, there are reports of declining mortuaries.
Reports of covid tests also have to wait for hours.
Many labs do not report before 48 to 72 hours.
A 35-year-old man I met outside a private lab in Noida told me, "I've been experiencing symptoms of covid for the last three days, so I'm worried.
But I'll have to wait 2-3 days for a report."
The black market of drugs
In the last few days, many posts have been appearing on social media in search of essential medicines.
Many have said that they do not have access to drugs such as remedicivir and toxilizumab.
The use of these two drugs for the treatment of Covid 19 is being discussed around the world, but some other countries, including India, have allowed the use of both drugs in case of emergency.
That is why there is a lot of demand for Remedesivir right now.
Despite India's ban on the export of these drugs, drug manufacturers in India cannot meet the demand.
In the last two days, more than two lakh new cases have been reported in India every day.
Earlier, one lakh to one and a half lakh patients were being registered every day for almost a week.
There are 7 companies producing Remedesivir in India.
Hetro Pharma is one of them.
The company says it is trying to increase production of the drug.
However, the BBC's investigation found that due to the shortage of the drug, remedesivir is being blackmailed in many other cities besides Delhi.
Speaking to the BBC, three marketing agents offered to give 100 grams of remedesivir for Rs 24,000.
This figure is five times higher than the official price of this drug.
Corona patients should be given 6 doses of this drug as per the instructions of the Union Ministry of Health of India.
Only then is the course of this medicine considered to be completed.
But many doctors say that some patients need to be given eight doses of remedivir, and for a middle-class family this amount can be large.
Atul Garg's mother had to be admitted to a private hospital in Delhi.
He says, "I had to spend a lot to get that medicine.
When I contacted hundreds of people, I got the medicine after walking for a few hours."
Tosilizumab, a drug used to treat arthritis, has also been approved for the treatment of covid 19.
But even this drug is almost missing from the Indian market.
Rajiv Singhal, general secretary of the All India Chemist and Druggist Association, says, "My phone rings all day long with calls for help to prescribe this drug.
But the situation is so bad that I can't even prescribe this drug for my family members.
We are trying to take action against the people.
But we have to admit that the system is leaking. "
Oxygen, X-ray and covid test
Demand for medical oxygen has increased in many states of India.
Many hospitals do not have space so they have to send patients back.
Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has demanded that the supply of oxygen to hospitals should be done by Air Force aircraft as it takes a long time to deliver oxygen to hospitals by road.
The situation in small towns is even worse.
Doctors are advising patients to arrange for oxygen cylinders at home if space is not available in the hospital.
Nabil Ahmed's father, who lives in a small village in northern India, contracted the corona.
Five days after realizing this, they started having trouble breathing.
The doctor advised them to bring an oxygen cylinder home.
They had to travel four hours to reach the city.
After an eight-hour journey, he was able to bring home an oxygen cylinder for his father.
Another big problem in small towns and villages is that private labs refuse to do X-rays and CT scans.
But doctors are using these options to check if the corona is infected.
Yogesh Kumar of Allahabad says that X-rays can be taken only after being admitted in a hospital.
You can also go to a government hospital, but there is a long waiting list.
A doctor in Allahabad told the BBC, "I can't even take X-rays of my patients.
For some patients, we rely entirely on blood test reports, but this is not correct."
Stress on cemeteries
Cheetahs burn day and night in cemeteries in many cities where the corona virus is highly contagious.
Families have to wait for hours to bury their loved ones.
A video of several cheetahs being set on fire at a cemetery in Lucknow at night had recently gone viral.
Cemetery staff work tirelessly.
Lalit Kant, an epidemiologist, says, "We did not learn from the first wave of corona infection.
We knew there would be a second wave of infection.
But we did not fill the shortage of medicines, hospitals and health care systems, oxygen. Not taken. "
Dharavi warriors who worked without a single day off during the Corona period
It's over! How to say that? If we don't go home, the number of patients will increase.
This is our job.
I didn't learn to be a doctor.
But the work done during Corona's time has been very satisfying.
People have a lot of respect.
I'm proud to be a health worker.
Go to any alley in Dharavi, Wadi in the morning ... Women with paper-pen in hand, face mask, bottle of sanitizer, oximeter and gun thermometer are seen going from house to house questioning people.
Ankita Shedge, Ulka Parab and Mirabai Kale ... you may not have heard these names.
However, Dharavikar is considered a family member.
These women have a backyard in Dharavi.
People's names are memorized.
But, who are these women?
Why are we talking about this?
You may have had such a question.
Covid warrior of Dharavi
Dharavi is known as the largest slum in Asia.
Dharavi became the hotspot of Covid-19 in the first wave of corona infection.
Everyone was afraid that the corona would spread rapidly in Dharavi.
But, these community health workers have stood and are standing as a shield in the fight against corona.
She is known as a health worker in Dharavi.
Without taking a year off, without fear of corona, these health workers are scrambling to save lives.
Every day, his work starts at 9 am.
One by one, the women cross the street and leave.
This has been going on for the last year and will continue until the end of the Corona, says Ankita Shedge.
The World Health Organization praised the Dharavi pattern for corona control.
The credit for this goes to the hard work of these health workers along with the administration.
'Proud to be a health worker'
Ulka Parab has been working as a health worker in Dharavi since 1990.
Thursday was his duty as usual.
Only by going from house to house, patients will be informed.
People will get treatment on time, their lives will be saved, she says.
Ulka Parab is responsible for the NL camp premises in Dharavi.
When we arrived, they were checking the house.
She tells of the experience of the first wave of the corona.
I saw the first case in Dharavi.
I was very scared.
There are children and husbands at home.
What about them?
This question was in my mind.
Why not be scared, I surveyed the area.
During the Corona period, not a single day of Ulka Parab took a holiday.
Afraid of Corona?
She says, "We've learned a lot over the last year.
It's not so scary now.
But, after going to the patients, you have to take proper care."
Dharavi Municipal Corporation has started a house-to-house search operation.
The big benefit of this is to find the suspect and the corona patient.
The support of the people is important to overcome the corona infection.
Did people support you over the last year?
She says, "When we left, people thought they had someone.
You came, don't worry, people say.
They feel confident after talking to us."
"I have been working as a community health worker for many years. "
But, I got real satisfaction from my work in Corona.
'Yes, the body is tired!'
While examining an 80-year-old grandmother, did you get tired of working all year? That's the question we asked.
The body is tired.
The soul is completely exhausted, it feels like work.
If you want to take a holiday for four or eight days and relax, Corona puts it on your head again.
The festival is over, Diwali is over.
Meteor's husband worked for a courier company.
"My mistress's job is gone.
They don't call me to work.
So we have to work," she says.
'Enough! How can you say that? '
Ankita Shedge is responsible for the Kumbharwada area of ​​Dharavi.
Ankita, who lived in Jogeshwari till last year, has now shifted to Dharavi.
It's over, I won't say that.
If we don't go home, the number of patients will increase.
We have to work.
While walking with Ankita, he suddenly started speaking in Gujarati.
How are you? How are you?
Ankita Shedge was questioning an old woman.
The area is inhabited by people who speak different languages.
So speaking in their own language, it is clear that people consider these health workers to be even more appealing.
These health workers do a great job of creating awareness among the elderly, children, men and women.
They are acting as a link between the administration and the general public.
She says, "I tell people, don't be afraid.
We want to get out of this.
We check them.
Some people call themselves.
They tell us the symptoms
Madam asks what to do.
Then, we send them to the quarantine center or hospital as needed."
In the second wave of corona infection, the number of patients in Dharavi is increasing again.
But, still many people are not seen walking around wearing masks, while some were seen wearing masks on their chins.
Ankita is somewhat annoyed with people's behavior.
"People don't listen.
They don't wear masks.
You said they wear masks.
They turn their backs and take them off again."
But, she says, people are more cooperative now than they were last year.
"Last year, people didn't come forward at all."
I tried to run away with PPE insects.
They didn't come out of the house.
'We have the world'
There are community health workers like Mira Kale, Ulka Parab and Ankita.
She says, I tell people, we're just like you.
We take care of ourselves.
You take care of the family, too."
People are growing sick because people don't listen.
People have a misconception that there is no corona.
Municipal Corporation providing medical services in Dharavi, Priyanka says, "In the first wave, people were afraid to go to the quarantine center.
But, now they know.
People are testing.
Quarantine is happening.
Covid is tired of working with other work.
But, we will keep working."

Aquarius and Corona: 'Seeing the situation in Haridwar, I left everything to God'
Mumbai resident Ujjwal Puri, a 34-year-old entrepreneur and photographer, arrived in Haridwar on the morning of March 9.
At the time, they had masks, sanitizers and vitamin pills.
Before boarding the flight to Dehradun, he thought that Haridwar would have very tight security.
They also thought that they would have difficulty getting access.
Ujjwal tried to register his covid negative test report on the go vernment website.
But the website was not running.
They reached Haridwar, but were not checked anywhere at the airport or after exiting.
He took some photos in 'Har Ki Paudi'.
Most of the devotees there did not have masks on their faces.
Most of the people who had a mask on their face had the mask slung under their nose or even on their chin.
Ujjwal took a photo on a ghat at night.
There was also a crowd of unmasked people on the steps of the ghat.
Some women have joined hands in an emotional gesture.
Some are changing clothes.
Someone is drying your hair with a towel.
Someone is dumb looking at a mobile.
Someone has a baby in their arms, while someone is seen chatting with others.
He says, "There was no such thing as social distance.
People used to stand facing each other during the evening aarti."
Ujjwal stayed in Kumbh Mela for three days.
In the meantime, I had taken out a mask to take selfies with Baba people only once in three days.
Ujjwal says, "I left everything to God."
Bright returned home three days later.
But they were scared at the time.
He said, "The first thing I did when I returned was to test the corona.
As soon as I entered the house, I locked myself in a room.
I have my parents in the house.
So I had to be careful."
According to government figures, corona has killed 1.33 lakh people in India so far.
Many states are in dire need of hospital beds, oxygen and medicines.
People are seen rushing to get a place in the hospital.
The cemetery also has queues for funerals.
In such a situation, the crowd of lakhs at Kumbh Mela is being referred to as a superspreader event.
Even during the Corona period, the Kumbh Mela held in BJP-ruled Uttarakhand is said to be the politics of Hindutva of the ruling party.
Gopal Bharadwaj, a historian living in Mussoorie, thinks that Kumbh Mela should have been avoided during the Corona period.
He said, "Do people who do not go for bathing in Aquarius become partners in sin?
This is for peace of mind.
If someone falls ill at home, what peace will there be?"
Gopal Bharadwaj says, "In the past, Kumbh Mela was held for only two weeks.
But in the last 35-40 years, due to marketing, its duration has increased."
He says, "The main bath in Kumbh Mela is Baisakhi.
But then Makar-Sankranti was associated with it.
Mahashivaratra also came in.
Shivratra is a different and important festival.
According to Gopal, Aquarius means religious conduct.
In the past it had a classical meaning.
It discussed how to save our religion.
Large arenas have been built for the protection of Hinduism.
In this, if there is a bad tendency in Hinduism, there is a discussion on how to keep it away.
But it was slowly diminishing.
Who has so much time now?
Are there so many scholars?
At the moment, the emphasis is on marketing everything. "
An atmosphere of fear among the people
According to Mithilesh Sinha, who runs a Dharamshala in Haridwar during the Kumbh Mela during the Corona period, there is an atmosphere of fear among the locals at present.
He says, "The devotees who come here leave in a day or two.
But it is not possible to say what prasad they will give to the locals.
It is very difficult to explain to the people when it comes time to discuss devotion."
The Corona virus does not know the difference between a believer and an atheist.
It is not clear how many covid positive patients were found in the Kumbh Mela from the beginning.
But an official said that about two hundred patients are found every day.
According to Kumbh Mela Covid Nodal Officer Dr. Avinash Khanna, there are 50 corona test centers here.
During Kumbh Mela, RTPCR test is being done for those who come to stay in Dharamshala and antigen test is being done for those who are returning, Khanna gave.
But the biggest concern is how much the virus will spread from covid positives returning home.
Petition in court
This fear has been mentioned by local resident Sachchidanand Dabral in his public interest litigation filed in the Nainital High Court.
He had filed the petition last year.
He had asked in the petition how the district administration could work to bring Kovid Saath under control when millions of people would come to Kumbh Mela.
Sachchidanand owns a pharma company.
He also runs a drug store.
According to him, the situation in Corona in Haridwar was under control in November-December.
Trivendra Singh Rawat was the Chief Minister at that time.
At that time, he had said that the negative RTPCR test report of the citizens coming to Kumbh Mela was mandatory.
But the new Chief Minister Tirath Singh Rawat, who was sworn in as the Chief Minister on March 10, did not impose any restrictions on the citizens attending the Kumbh Mela.
On the day of Mahashivaratri on March 11, 36 to 37 lakh people arrived at Haridwar Ghat.
Since then, the situation in Haridwar has started deteriorating, said Sachchidanand.
The court has said that 50,000 tests should be done here every day.
But the number of tests here has never gone beyond 9,000 to 10,000, he said.
But the cowardly nodal officer of Kumbh Mela, Dr. Avinash Khanna denies the allegation.
According to the court order, more than 50,000 tests are being conducted every day, he said.
A committee formed by the court following Sachchidanand's petition had visited the ghats in March.
He then submitted his report to the court.
Sachchidanand's lawyer Shiv Bhatt, who is also a member of the committee, said, "The committee's inspection revealed that the condition of the ghats was very bad.
After inspecting the ghats, we went to a hospital in Rishikesh.
There is a covid center for the entire Garhwal.
There is no ultrasound facility.
The condition of toilets and wards is very bad.
There are no bed pans, no trash cans.
The elevator here is out of order. "
Officials were claiming that the two crore crowd was handled properly that day.
But on the day of the royal bath, the administration could not control even a crowd of three million, Bhatt said.
Appreciate the work of the administration
But 25-year-old Sandeep Shinde, who came from Mumbai to participate in the Kumbh Mela, praised the work of the police and administration in Haridwar.
Sandeep is a painter by profession.
They are staying in a large hall in an ashram in Haridwar.
Here 10 other devotees like him are lying on the ground with mattresses.
Sandeep came to Kumbh Mela alone.
He said that he had come to experience this festival which is held once in twelve years.
It was a great pleasure for me to come here, to experience the royal bath.
Sandeep himself uses a mask.
After returning to the ashram, they wash their hands, feet and mouth with hot water.
He said, "I haven't heard of Corona anywhere.
Nobody talks about Corona here."
But in many cases, Kumbh Mela is being called a 'super spreader event'.
A senior journalist from Dehradun thinks that after the end of Kumbh Mela, a very divisive picture will be created in Uttarakhand.
According to government figures, 1800 people have died due to corona in Uttarakhand so far.
Raghavendra Das of Panch Ramanandiya Khaki Akhada admitted that people are scared.
But he goes on to say, "People are not afraid of death when it comes to faith and religion.
Doesn't Corona spread from the election, why shouldn't she be considered a superspreader?
Does Corona only spread to religious places?
Governments that name Indian culture are opening liquor stores.
Punch Ramanandiya asked whether the corona does not spread from there.
Omkar Das, who was sitting next to him, said that the real reason behind people falling ill in Haridwar was the atmosphere here.
Haridwar is hot during the day and cold at night. Besides, not a single positive patient with 100 per cent corona has been found here, he said.
Corona: Corona is spreading rapidly among the youth due to 'these' reasons
I'm not going to have a corona, it's a misconception.
I'm a bodybuilder.
People think about how I'm going to have a corona.
No one can guarantee that I'm going to have a corona. .
The superintendent of KEM Hospital, Mumbai, Dr. Hemant Deshmukh's words are forever remembered by everyone.
The second wave of corona infection is spreading rapidly in Maharashtra.
Not big cities like Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur.
Rural areas have also been affected by the tsunami.
According to experts, mutated coronavirus is a highly contagious, highly contagious, and immunosuppressive virus.
So in the second wave, many families are being coronated.
What is the difference between the first and second wave of Covid-19 infection?
Why is corona infection so prevalent among young people?
In this regard, we have Dr. Learned from Hemant Deshmukh.
Q - What Coronas in the first wave and the second wave This uniqueness of this?
Dr. Hemant Deshmukh - In the first wave of corona infection, people between the ages of 15 and 40 did not show much infection.
Corona infections were more common in people with diabetes, high blood pressure, lung failure, or lung disease.
People with comorbidities and no other illnesses are more likely to be infected with corona.
Infection is less common in patients on dialysis.
But those who do not have any disease, those who are healthy, are more likely to have coronary heart disease.
Question - any disease between the ages of 15 and 30 who are not young men Corona getting more exposure?
Is the disease serious?
Dr. Hemant Deshmukh - A young man suffering from Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) was admitted to hospital last year.
But this year, the incidence of corona among young people between the ages of 15 and 30 has increased.
Importantly, people come to the hospital eight to ten days after the symptoms appear.
It is important to recognize the first day of illness.
It is necessary to be admitted to the hospital before the fifth or sixth day after the illness.
But this time, it is felt that the educated youth stay at home for a long time.
This is because they do some blood tests.
Perform high resolution CT scan (HRCT) and RTPCT test at home.
It takes three days for a report to arrive in a private lab.
These three days are proving to be detrimental.
This class ignores treatment until the report is positive.
About 20 per cent of the patients admitted to KEM are young.
They have been diagnosed with a serious form of infection.
Importantly, educated youth see the CT (Cycle Threshold) value of the RTPCT test.the viral load in the body.
All those with a CT value greater than 35 will be negative.
The lower the CT value, the higher
Young people with an HRCT value of more than 5/25, on the other hand, are walking out without a hitch.
It is not possible to dispel misconceptions among these educated people.
Which is the most important.
Q - Can strong people get corona infection?
Dr. Hemant Deshmukh - People misunderstand that I will not be a corona.
People give examples, other places are crowded.
There is no corona.
No one has guaranteed that Corona won’t happen.
People should think that I can be a corona too.
No matter how healthy I am, I can get corona infection.
This is because the virus does not age.
The disease affects everyone from newborns to 100-year-olds.
The young class is behaving carelessly.
Going out for parties, weekends, going out even when there is no work is making the younger generation more infected.
Q - How dangerous is the second wave of corona infection?
Is the virus spreading through the air?
Dr. Hemant Deshmukh - This is not the second wave.
This has to be called a tsunami.
A tsunami is worse than a wave.
Compared to last year, Corona has taken on a more formidable form.
Corona virus is a cause for concern.
Importantly, the virus is spread through the air. I
n the first wave, the corona infection was thought to be caused by coughing or by contact with any surface.spreading through the air.
That is why it is very important to use a mask.
This mask should not be cloth.
Use a triple layer or surgical mask.
If you feel uncomfortable after using the mask, then the mask should be considered good.
In Japan, if two people come together, it is considered a crowd.
But you don't feel comfortable without meeting five people.
The two should understand the crowd.
Most importantly, eat alone while eating.
Do not speak with the mask down.
Q - Are the symptoms different in the first and second waves?
Dr. Hemant Deshmukh - The number of patients suffering from heart attack, brain stroke, blood clots in the legs or gangrene was high after the first wave of corona infection.
But in the second wave, red eyes, no taste in the mouth, no smell.
Symptoms include cold, cough, fever, fatigue and arthritis.
Q - Is the double mutation in the corona virus spreading the infection?
Dr. Hemant Deshmukh - There are changes in the virus.
The corona virus also took 400 days to mutate.
We mingled with the people.
As a result, the virus mutated.
You have started vaccination to fight this virus.
Heard immunity will be created if immunity is developed in people.
Question - were health workers are doing work around the clock throughout the year?
How is their mood?
Dr. Hemant Deshmukh - 400 days have passed since the beginning of Corona.
All the doctors are serving the coronaries.
But I am constantly tired from working.
Fatigue has definitely come after 400 days.
But, why all the doctors do it with one eye.
No matter how severe the tsunami, we will continue to strive for patients.
Q - What message will you give to the youth ?
Dr. Hemant Deshmukh - You are the backbone of the family.
So be careful.
You want to judge the next generation.
I want to take care of the previous generation.
So we need to be strong. Is.
The 35 years of strength you have can’t beat Corona.
You will be safe and your family will be safe if you follow the triad of mask, cleanliness and social distance.
Corona symptoms: Why is happy hypoxia fatal for corona sufferers?
Covid-19 has claimed millions of lives worldwide so far.
These numbers are increasing day by day.
The situation in Maharashtra is deteriorating.
If there is a condition called happy hypoxia with this disease, then the patient's distress is further aggravated.
Let's see what exactly this condition is and how it puts the patient at risk.
'Shortness of breath'
The corona virus infects the patient's lungs.
The corona virus spreads or multiplies in large numbers after infiltration into the lungs.
Which makes it difficult for patients to breathe.
In medical parlance this is called 'shortness of breath'.
In the critical stage there is no breathing, the oxygen level in the body drops drastically and the patient feels the need for oxygen or ventilator support.
If the patient is having difficulty breathing, the doctor may instantly inspect the corona.
Shortness of breath is one of the main symptoms of corona infection.
What is Happy Hypoxia?
Doctors in Mumbai and Maharashtra are seeing a rare symptom of Covid-19.
In which the amount of oxygen in the body of covid positive patients is very low, but the patients do not have difficulty in breathing.
Although the oxygen level in the body is low, the patient looks normal.
There are no symptoms of obstruction of breathing.
In medical parlance, doctors call this 'Happy Hypoxia'.
In Maharashtra, 7106 patients have died due to Covid-19 till June 26.
More than 4,000 corona victims have died in Mumbai.
Cases of 'Happy Hypoxia' have also been reported in the state.
The doctor suffered from happy hypoxia
The famous General Physician from Santacruz area of ​​Mumbai, Dr. Vasant Shenoy also suffered from 'Happy Hypoxia'.
He was admitted to the hospital due to low oxygen level in his body.
A few days ago, Dr. Shenoy overcame Kovid and returned home.
But, they still have to take half a liter of oxygen every minute.
How does Happy Hypoxia suffer?
Recognizable?
In this regard, we have Dr. Tried to know Shenoy's experience.
Speaking to the BBC, Dr. Vasant Shenoy says, "A normal person has 95 to 99 per cent oxygen in his body.
If the oxygen level in the blood drops below 90 per cent, he starts having trouble breathing.
However, my acquaintance Dr. Abhishek Bhargava diagnosed me with 'Happy Hypoxia'.
This is a rare symptom of Kovid-19.
'Even though the oxygen level in the body is low, breathing is not difficult, hence the name' Happy Hypoxia '.
However, there is no such thing as being happy.
‘Happy hypoxia’ is a serious condition.
Stealth gradually lowers the level of oxygen in the body, without even realizing it, and the consequences become serious.
I couldn't diagnose it, but, fortunately, my friend diagnosed it on time, which saved my life, 'said Dr. Called Shenoy.
What is 'hypoxia'?
Every cell in our body needs oxygen to survive.
This oxygen is carried from the blood to every cell.
Hypoxia is a decrease in the level of oxygen in the blood.
Blood carries oxygen to the organs of the body.
However, in happy hypoxia, the oxygen required by the cells in the body is not carried by the blood in sufficient quantity.
Is ‘Happy Hypoxia’ Common?
Dr. Shenoy further says, "I have not seen this condition in general in my practice.
I have identified many corona suspected patients and sent them to the hospital.
However, corona has given more information about happy hypoxia condition.
As a result, the oxygen level in the body goes down.
But, as there are no symptoms, it is too late for the bud."
Talking to BBC about this, Infectious Diseases Specialist of Jaslok Hospital, Mumbai, Dr. Om Srivastava says, "Happy hypoxia is found in 10 to 12 per cent of patients with heart disease and lung disease.
If left untreated, it can lead to major complications.
There are many causes of happy hypoxia.
'Many patients come to the hospital with very low oxygen levels.
These patients look normal even when there is less oxygen.
They do not show any symptoms, "said Dr. Srivastava.
Mohan Joshi, superintendent of Nair Hospital, told the BBC: "People with lung disease have low levels of oxygen in their bodies.
These patients are tuned for low oxygen levels.
They look normal, but the amount of oxygen in the body is very critical.
For this, it is very important to go to the community and find a patient.
So that if the amount of oxygen in the body of the people is low, they can be treated immediately by X-rays and other tests, 'said Dr. Joshi continued.
Symptoms of hypoxia
According to Web-MD ,
Skin discoloration,
Confusion situation
Cough, sudden increase in heart rate
Breathing loudly
Sudden sweating
What should the common man do?
It is possible to measure the level of oxygen in the body even if you are at home.
With the help of pulse oximeter we can easily check the oxygen level in the body.
Dr. Shenoy says, "I have experienced 'Happy Hypoxia'.
So I urge everyone to check their oxygen level 10 times a day.
There is no other option but to live with covid infection.
To save lives, have 1 pulse oximeter in every house. It is necessary. '
Timely diagnosis of each disease is of utmost importance.
Former Director of Mumbai Municipal Hospital and Chairman of the Death Audit Committee of the State Government, Dr. Avinash Supe says, "Patients with happy hypoxia look like normal people.
But, while doing an activity, their health suddenly deteriorates.
They suffer from it for some time.
But, after that, they recover.
It is important to diagnose it in time.
Happy hypoxia patients have reduced lung function.
so they have difficulty breathing in the second stage.
And the third stage is the need for a ventilator in the most severe cases, he said, called Supe.
What causes hypoxia?
Pulmonary Physician of Lilavati Hospital, Mumbai, Dr. Jalil Parkar himself got rid of Corona by facing Kovid-19.
Dr. Parakar said, "It is very rare for people to have difficulty breathing despite having very little oxygen in the body.
Severe asthma, lung damage, pneumonia can lead to hypoxia.
While investigating the cause of death due to Covid-19 in the state, the health system has also come to know about 'Happy Hypoxia'.
Speaking to BBC Marathi about 'Happy Hypoxia', the state health commissioner Dr. Anup Kumar Yadav said, "Investigations into the deaths of corona sufferers have revealed several cases of 'happy hypoxia'.
Happy hypoxia can be a manifestation of corona virus.
This trend is found in Mumbai and Maharashtra.
Approximately 2K3% of people have 'happy hypoxia'.
'This patient was coronary.
However, even after the oxygen level in the body decreased, they did not have any difficulty in breathing, 'said Dr. Anup Kumar further said.
We have provided information about 'Happy Hypoxia' in the Death Audit Report of Covid Patients.
Corona: 'Beds should be increased according to the growth rate' - Rajesh Tope
As the number of patients in the state is increasing, so should the number of beds," Health Minister Rajesh Tope said.
"There should be no situation where there are no beds," he said today.
From the Health Services Commissionerate, the Health Minister held a review meeting with the Director of Health, Joint Director, Divisional Deputy Director, District Surgeon, District Health Officer, Taluka Health Officer through video conference.
At this time, the principal secretary of the health department, Dr. Pradeep Vyas, Commissioner Dr. Ramaswamy, Director Dr. Archana Patil, Dr. Sadhana Tayde, Co-Commissioner Dr. Satish Pawar was also present.
He further said, "Institutional quarantine of such persons should be done as the whole house is coronated due to lack of space in the house in home isolation."
A person with coronary heart disease has mild symptoms and if there is a shortage of space in their home, the place where they are segregated is called institutional quarantine.
The administration takes care of a school or a mangal office where the patients are provided with food and medicine.
Regarding the shortage of remedesivir in the state, Tope said, "The task force has formulated regulations on the use of oxygen and remedesivir.
Some doctors are using ramadesivir when there are very mild symptoms.
This makes the shortage appear."
Talking about the shortage of oxygen, Rajesh Tope said, "Hospitals with 50 or more beds should start oxygen production projects and try to become self-sufficient.
At present, efforts are being made to bring in oxygen from outside states.
The companies manufacturing the remedies have reduced the supply.
They are trying to hold a meeting with the central government to talk to Devendra Fadnavis about the supply of the vaccine, Tope said.
Remedicivir will be supplied to private hospitals in view of the active number of patients.
District Surgeons should control both these factors while planning the beds, Tope said.
District Surgeons should pay special attention to ensure that the benefit of Mahatma Jotiba Phule Janaarogya Yojana is not denied to the patients.
He also said that the environment, cleanliness, quality of food, cleanliness of toilets in Kovid Centers should be monitored and if necessary, staff from other departments should be called in to help.
He said awareness-raising about corona is needed, while trying to control those who have symptoms and try to get them to bed.
'Find the cause of rising mortality'
The health minister expressed concern over the rising death rate in the state.
He said, "Find out the reasons for the rising mortality rate in some districts.
Patients are arriving late for treatment and awareness should be created for timely admission so that patients come to the hospital on time as soon as symptoms appear."
He further said that a meeting of private medical professionals in the field of rural hospitals and sub-district hospitals should be convened and the health minister should instruct the patients not to undergo unnecessary treatment while testing the patients immediately.
In many places, positive patients are not taking home isolation seriously, so they should be institutionally isolated, the health minister said.
Corona virus: Corona's double mutation found in 61% of genome sequencing samples
Covid-19 infection is spreading rapidly in Maharashtra.
More than 58,000 corona patients were registered in the state on April 14.
Over the past few days, more than 50,000 corona patients are being registered in the state every day.
The second wave of corona infection is spreading like a tsunami in the state.
At present there are more than 6 lakh active patients in Maharashtra.
Eighty percent of these patients have no symptoms.
However, the number of critically ill patients admitted to the hospital is increasing day by day.
Is the 'double mutation' in the corona virus responsible for the outbreak of corona infection in the state? This question reappears.
Because of this, the report of ‘genome sequencing’ of corona patients is shocking.
The National Institute of Virology (NIV) has informed the state government about the report on 'Genome Sequencing' of Kovid-19 patients in Maharashtra.
What is the NIV report?
Genome sequencing of corona patients is being done at the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune.
According to PTI, genome sequencing of 361 coronavirus samples from Maharashtra was done in NIV.
Of these, double mutations were found in 61 per cent of the samples.
Samples of coronaviruses were collected for genome sequencing from January to March.
The Union Ministry of Health had on March 24 informed that a 'double mutation' had been detected in Maharashtra.
Two mutations, E484Q and L452R, have been found in the corona virus.
This mutation was found in 15 to 20 per cent of the samples collected from Maharashtra.
But the central government said there was no concrete evidence that the mutation was the cause of the second wave of infections.
Infection spread due to 'double mutation'?
The second wave of Covid-19 infection in Maharashtra started spreading rapidly in February.
Why is the corona virus spreading so fast?
Genome sequencing was done to find out.
Infectious pathologist from Mumbai, Dr. Ishwari Prasad Gilada says, "This 'double mutation' is very contagious.
It is likely to increase the prevalence of corona infection four to eight times in 3 weeks.
Mutations in the corona virus were found in Amravati, Akola, Yavatmal, Nagpur, Pune and Wardha districts of Vidarbha.
A member of the state's Covid-19 taskforce, Dr. Shashank Joshi said, "This new virus is spreading rapidly.
There is a different pattern of mutated viruses."
According to experts, "E484Q is an escape mutation.
Mutations in the spike protein cause the body's antibodies to recognize the mutated virus to a lesser extent, thus increasing its severity."
So, the L452R mutation, first discovered in the United States, is known to spread rapidly.
The increase in the number of coronavirus patients in the state is putting a huge strain on health facilities.
Due to the high severity of the infection, many people are being hospitalized in critical condition.
The virus is affecting more than one person, he said, Gilada said.
Is 'double mutation' a cause for concern?
Experts say the 'double mutation' found in the corona virus is certainly a cause for concern.
The director of the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, Dr. Anurag Agarwal says, "Double mutations are definitely a cause for concern.
But, it cannot be said for sure that this has led to an increase in the number of patients across the country, or the spread of corona.
This mutation was first detected in February-March."
According to experts, this 'double mutation' found in India has been given the classical name of B.1.617.
Infectious Disease Specialist Dr. Kokilaben Hospital, Mumbai. Tanu Singhal says, "The situation in the state has changed abruptly in the last two months.
It is certain that a new virus has spread.
So one of the reasons for the outbreak is double mutation.
The potential for the new virus to spread is very high."
Experts say the first wave of corona did not infect everyone in the family.
But in the second wave, the whole family appears to be infected with the corona.
There have been several mutations in the corona virus.
But, at the moment, our focus is on two mutations, the E484Q and the L452R, he said.
Anurag Agarwal further said.
Corona: Maharashtra's battle for oxygen, what are the problems and solutions?
here is no need to explain why oxygen is called oxygen in Marathi.
But the corona virus has reminded us of the importance of oxygen.
Regular supply of oxygen to patients has become a major challenge facing the healthcare system in India.
Especially in Maharashtra, there is a shortage of oxygen.
State Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray expressed concern over the issue and while interacting with the public through Facebook on Tuesday, said that he had requested the Center to provide oxygen by air.
But exactly how inflammatory is the situation? What are the problems in oxygen supply and basically what is the benefit of oxygen to covid patients?
How big is the oxygen shortage in Maharashtra?
Considering Maharashtra, the state produces about 1200 metric tons of oxygen per day.
This oxygen is used for medical as well as industrial purposes.
The Chief Minister has said that at present, 100 per cent oxygen is reserved for health facilities in the state in view of Kovid's support.
He also said that currently 950 to 1000 tonnes of oxygen is being used in the state per day.
Despite such a large scale production, there is already a shortage of oxygen in some parts of the state.
Given the growing number of patients in the state, it is a fact that more oxygen will be needed in the coming days.
According to experts, in the next few weeks, Maharashtra may need 1500 to 1600 metric tons of oxygen per day.
But meeting this increased demand for oxygen is not easy.
How is oxygen produced?
When there is an abundance of oxygen (about 21 percent) in the air, you may be wondering how it is produced.
The scientific process behind it is a bit complicated.
But to put it simply, the classical term is converted into a liquid under pressure.
It is easy to separate the components in such liquefied air.
It produces pure and liquid oxygen or nitrogen.
This liquefied oxygen is pale blue in color and very cold.
Its temperature is minus 183 degrees Celsius.
Such superfluous gases are called cryogenic gases .
Although maintaining this temperature is a challenge, it is convenient to store and transport such gases in liquid form.
For this it is filled under pressure in a liquefied oxygen cylinder.
There are 500 such factories in India.
But not all the oxygen it produces is used for medical treatment.
Before Kovid's arrival, only 15 per cent of the oxygen produced in India was used in medical treatment.
The rest of the oxygen was used in oil refining projects or in areas such as the iron industry, car manufacturing, blast furnaces.
The industry was shut down during the lockdown last year, so hospitals continued to be supplied with oxygen.
But after the lockdown, the demand for oxygen from the industry increased.
However, priority is given to hospitals.
At present, more than half of the country's oxygen is used for medical treatment, according to preliminary estimates.
Now that demand has increased, it is not possible to set up new oxygen factories immediately.
Moreover, the question is not only how to increase the production of oxygen, but also how to transport it.
Oxygen transport challenges
Oxygen is supplied by tankers from factories producing oxygen in India.
In some places the tanker is brought directly to the hospital and then oxygen is delivered directly to each bed through a pipe.
In some places, in the refill plant, ie in small factories, the oxygen from the tanker is filled into the cylinders and then the cylinders are supplied to the hospitals.
But in such places the cylinders may need to be changed frequently.
While this arrangement may seem easy to read, there are actually a number of rules to follow when transporting an oxygen cylinder .
Liquid oxygen helps in combustion and therefore care should be taken to avoid any accidents.
It uses a special type of cryogenic tank and a truck that can carry it.
According to the All India Industrial Gas Manufacturers Association, there are about 1,500 such trucks in India.
What are the problems in oxygen transport in Maharashtra?
In Maharashtra, liquid oxygen is produced in a few places like Taloja, Pune and Nagpur near Mumbai.
But from there it takes time to reach other cities.
It takes two and a half to three hours to fill a tanker in a factory that produces oxygen.
So often empty tankers have to stand in line outside the factory.
When the tanker is full, it cannot run fast.
A speed limit of 40 kmph has been imposed on the transport of such tankers.
Also, due to the high number of accidents at night, these tankers do not travel after ten.
In places like Pune in the state, the administration had given oxygen tankers the status of ambulances.
This means that if there is a traffic jam, these trains can go ahead with priority.
But despite such measures, in cities like Nanded, the tankers are getting late, says local journalist Yogesh Latkar.
It takes about 25 hours for the oxygen tankers to reach Nanded from the bottom, 18 hours from Pune and 15 hours from Nagpur.
When an oxygen tanker arrives here, it almost starts filling up in cylinders.
This is what it looks like when a water tanker fills up in a drought prone area.
Ganesh Bhartiya, owner of an oxygen refill plant in Nanded, says, "We used to sell 150 to 200 cylinders a day.
Now the demand has gone up to 500 to 600 cylinders a day.
The oxygen supply to the industry is now cut off and all the cylinders go to hospitals."
He says that he has to work many hours more than usual and it is difficult to meet the demand.
They also say that it may take months for suppliers like you to increase production.
The main reasons are lack of capital, lack of cylinders and lack of manpower.
Skills are needed to handle liquid oxygen, or to supply it to a hospital.
However, an official of the Food and Drug Administration, while talking to BBC Marathi, observed that up to 20 per cent oxygen is being wasted due to lack of practice or leakage in the supply process.
Air transport and other options
When Maharashtra started experiencing scarcity, some oxygen was supplied from neighboring states like Gujarat and Karnataka.
But even this state can stop the supply now as the number of patients is increasing.
According to PTI, Health Minister Rajesh Tope informed about this while talking to reporters in Mumbai.
So the government will now focus on not wasting oxygen.
Meanwhile, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has sought help from the Center, including the option of air transport and military assistance.
In this regard, we contacted Saket Tikku, President, All India Gas Manufacturers Association.
We are in discussions with the government on how to increase the oxygen supply and a decision will be taken soon, he said.
Why do Kovid patients need oxygen supply?
ERV We inhale oxygen through the air.
This oxygen enters the bloodstream through the lungs and reaches the cells through the bloodstream.
There it is chemically processed with glucose, which means food is converted into energy.
This process is the most important for the survival of living things.
In some diseases or if a microbial infection develops in the lungs, it interferes with the process of oxygenation in the blood.
In this case, the oxygen that is inhaled as usual is not enough.
Patients are then supplied with pure oxygen.
In some diseases, oxygen concentrator is used for this purpose.
But one thing to keep in mind.
It is up to the doctor to decide whether the patient needs to take oxygen by machine or cylinder.
This is because pure oxygen can cause some accidents.
What did Raj Thackeray send a letter to Narendra Modi about the corona measures?
MNS president Raj Thackeray has requested the Center to provide 100 per cent vaccination in Maharashtra to combat corona infection.
He has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in this regard.
Raj Thackeray said in the letter, "The first wave of Covid-19 and the ensuing national lockout have taken a heavy toll on the people of Maharashtra.
We are still experiencing its economic and social repercussions across the country."
Maharashtra cannot afford to impose repeated restrictions and declarations to stop this new wave.
They are not a permanent solution.
But if the state does not get enough vaccines, what is the alternative?
Against this backdrop, the strategy of 100% vaccination is important and key for Maharashtra if it is to corona infection.
Therefore, with the goal of 100% vaccination in Maharashtra, 100% of people of all ages in the state should be vaccinated as soon as possible. "
Raj Thackeray has suggested some options to provide the necessary vaccines to Maharashtra.
Raj Thackeray has suggested that the state, private institutions in the state should be allowed to buy vaccines separately, and Serum Institute should be allowed to sell freely but with proper regulation in Maharashtra.
Apart from this, organizations like Halfkin and Hindustan Antibiotics should be allowed to produce vaccines in the state, and the state should be given the go-ahead to streamline the supply of medicines like Remedesivir required for the treatment of Covid-19, Raj Thackeray said in the letter.
Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had said in his speech yesterday (April 13) that he would write a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding oxygen supply in the state.
What are the characteristics of Sputnik-5 vaccine?
How does this vaccine work in the body?
India has paved the way for a third vaccine.
Russia's Sputnik-5 vaccine has been approved by the Union Ministry.
The vaccine was developed by Russia's Gamalaya Center.
Currently, Covishield of Serum Institute and Covacin vaccine of Bharat Biotech are being used in India.
Sputnik will now be the third vaccine available in India.
This decision is considered important considering the increase in the number of patients in India over the last few days.
In addition, in the last few days, many states have been attacking the central government for not supplying vaccines.
The decision is expected to resolve the issue of vaccine supply.
Sputnik-5 vaccine Dr. Russia has said it will give Reddy to the lab. 10 crore dose of Sputnik-5 vaccine Russia has made it clear that it will give Reddy to the lab.
The Russian Direct Investment Fund will cooperate for the clinical trial and distribution of the vaccine.
Russian Direct Investment Fund and Dr. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has been signed between Reddy Labs and 30 crore doses of vaccine will be manufactured in India.
Dr. Reddy is one of the leading pharma companies in the country.
Scientists in Russia have published the first report on vaccine research in the world-renowned medical journal The Lancet .
According to the report, the initial tests of the vaccine in Russia showed signs of an immune response to the vaccine.
The vaccine is said to be 92% successful against covid-19.
The people who took the test tested positive for antibodies against the corona virus.
Notably, this test did not cause any serious side effects.
Such a claim was made by Russian scientists in a report in The Lancet.
The vaccine was developed at the Gamaleya Institute, a government research center in the Russian capital, Moscow.
What else is available about Sputnik-5?
The vaccine was initially the subject of controversy because it was made available to the public before the final test report of the vaccine was available.
But scientists say the benefits of the vaccine are now well-known.
This vaccine uses a cold-like virus.
The virus is harmless but acts as a carrier of the cold-virus to release a small portion of the corona virus into the body.
To the extent that this carrier carries the genetic code of the corona virus to the body, the immune system will recognize and fight the threat in the future, even without getting sick.
Once vaccinated, the body begins to make antibodies.
These antibodies are specially formulated to fight against corona virus.
This means that when a real virus enters the body, these antibodies can fight off promptly.
The vaccine can be stored at a temperature of 2 to 8 C.
The temperature in a simple fridge is around 5 degrees Celsius so the vaccine can be sent here and there in comfort.
A separate vaccine for the second dose
What is different about Sputnik-5 is that the vaccines for the first and second doses are different.
The second dose of the vaccine is slightly different from the first.
Both doses are to be given at intervals of 21 days.
Both doses target the spike of the corona virus but use different vectors.
Vectors are harmless viruses used in vaccines.
The purpose behind using two different formulas to make the vaccine is to boost the immune system.
Giving two doses of two different vaccines instead of two doses of the same vaccine can further boost the immune system and prevent corona for a longer period of time.
This vaccine is effective but there is no risk from it.
The vaccine did not pose any serious risk during the tests.
Of course some side-effects of this vaccine are expected.
But they are mild.
It can cause side effects such as hand pain, fatigue, and mild fever.
But the group of people who were tested for the vaccine did not have any serious illness or death.
In addition to Russia, the Sputnik-5 vaccine is used in Argentina, parts of Palestine, Venezuela, Hungary, the UAE and Iran.
The vaccine is available in India in a few weeks.
Until then, however, the vaccine dollar has survived on only two vaccines, Kovacin and Kovishield.
What is covacin?
Covacin is an inactivated vaccine that uses the dead corona virus.
The vaccine can kill the corona virus if it enters the body, but it does not pose a risk.
The vaccine is manufactured by Bharat Biotech.
Bharat Biotech has over 24 years of experience.
During this time they have made 16 vaccines and exported them to 123 countries.
Bharat Biotech used a sample of corona virus isolated by the National Institute of Virology of India to develop the vaccine.
After vaccination, the body's immune system can detect the structure of the dead corona virus.
This helps the immune system to understand what the corona virus is and how to fight it.
Two doses of this vaccine should be taken every four weeks.
The vaccine can be stored at 2 to 8 C.
Preliminary data from the third round of trials show that the vaccine is 81% effective.
The vaccine was approved in January, which raised eyebrows among many experts.
Bharat Biotech currently has a stock of 2 crore doses and intends to make 70 crore doses over the next year.
Why was Kovacin found in the controversy?
The vaccine was approved in January as an "emergency.
The regulator had said, We are approving the use of the vaccine in emergencies, especially when there are new mutations in the virus, in the public interest, despite ongoing testing of the vaccine."
But experts questioned how the vaccine, which will be given to millions of people as a preventative measure, could be an 'emergency treatment'.
The All India Drug Action Network said at the time, "We are confused as to what could be the scientific reason for approving a vaccine that has not been fully studied.
The lack of complete data is certainly a cause for concern."
But both the manufacturer and the regulator followed Kovacin, saying, "This vaccine is safe and gives a strong immune response."
Bharat Biotech said India's clinical trial laws made it easier for the vaccine to be approved "as soon as possible".
After the second round of tests for the vaccine, "this was done in view of the severity of the life-threatening disease."
What is Covishield?
The vaccine was jointly developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca.
The Pune-based Serum Institute of India is responsible for the production of Kovishield.
This is the first vaccine to be approved in India.
We are producing more than 6 crore doses a month, says Serum.
This vaccine is made from a weaker version of the corona virus.
This weak virus is called adenovirus and is found in chimpanzees.
It has been modified to look like a corona virus, but it does not make a person sick.
When the vaccine is injected into the body, it boosts the immune system to make antibodies against the corona virus.
There are also two doses of this vaccine that are expected to be given at 4 to 12 week intervals.
The vaccine can also be stored at 2 to 8 C and can be easily distributed in the current healthcare system.
The vaccine developed by Pfizer-Biotech, on the other hand, has to be stored at temperatures as low as -70 (minus seventy) degrees Celsius and can be moved very rarely.
In a country like India, this is challenging as temperatures can reach up to 50 degrees Celsius in summer.
How effective is Covishield?
Covishield was found to be 90 percent effective after half and then full doses, according to international tests.
But there was not enough data to support the idea of ​​a half-full dose.
Of course, according to unpublished data, the difference between the first and second doses increased by several days.
In the small group on which the experiment was performed, the vaccine was found to be 70 percent effective.
Serum says Kovishield is 'very effective'.
He cited the example of third phase tests in Brazil and the UK.
But the patient rights group All India Action Network says the vaccine has been hastily approved.
The vaccine makers have not studied from an Indian perspective.
What other vaccines are available?
In addition, trials of some vaccines are underway in India.
Ahmedabad-based Zydus-Cadila is currently developing the Zykov-D vaccine.
Hyderabad-based Biological E is the first private vaccine manufacturer in India.
The company is developing a vaccine with Dynavax and Baylor College of Medicine in the United States.
India's first mRNA vaccine HGCO19 is being manufactured in Pune.
The Genoa-based company is partnering with HDT Biotech in the United States to develop a vaccine that uses the genetic code to trigger an immune response.
India is developing a biotech vaccine.
The Serum Institute and American vaccine development company Novavax are working together to develop another.
Which countries will use India's vaccine?
India has sent 6.4 crore doses of vaccines to 86 countries.
These include countries in South America, the Caribbean, Asia, and Africa.
It also includes the UK, Canada, Brazil and Mexico.
Both covshield and covacin vaccines are being exported.
Some doses are given as a 'gift' because vaccine companies and countries that receive vaccines have entered into some agreements.
The remaining vaccines are being sent under the Covax scheme.
Kovacs is led by the World Health Organization and hopes to deliver more than two billion doses to people in 190 countries in the coming year.
But in March 2021, India banned the export of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines.
The government has banned exports of vaccines to India due to rising demand in the country due to rising cases in the country.
Corona Lockdown: Does Corona Spread if the Store Is Open?
Lockdown is being considered at the government level as corona infection is on the rise in the state.
Traders in the state staged agitation against the decision.
Merchants in Pune had also decided to open shops today.
But a meeting of traders took place late last night.
It has decided to postpone the decision to open shops till today.
Also, after the decision of today's meeting of the Chief Minister, the next role will be decided by the traders.
Fatehchand Ranka, president of the Pune Chamber of Commerce and Industry, has raised some questions against the government's decision to close shops.
We have the answers to those questions from the state health advisor Dr. Attempts have been made to get it from Subhash Salunke.
Traders claim experts answer him
1. Vegetable market is open, corona can spread even from food stalls, so why are there no restrictions on them?
If the trader or employee is a super spreader, the risk of spreading from him is higher.
People are in the shops for a long time so they are more likely to get infected.
While many shops do not have adequate ventilation, many stores have AC so spread can be widespread.
The vegetable market can also be spread by food vendors, but the main difference is that the vegetable market is in an open space, with shops closed.
Corona will not happen in one place and it will not happen in a particular place at all but if the shops continue it can spread more.
It is claimed that the shop continued to be crowded.
Factories are open, there are hundreds of people working there, they go by the same bus, they can also cause infections.
There is a difference between the number of employees working in factories and the number of employees that traders have and the number of customers that come to them.
Not all the blame lies with the traders, but it is important to close in places where more people can come together.
E-commerce is allowed.
Delivery boys can go from house to house delivering goods, they can also spread the corona.
The order stipulates that delivery boys must be tested when allowing e-commerce, so they will be able to work only after testing.
The situation in Pune is deteriorating.
The trade has been closed for the last eight days, but the number of patients does not appear to have decreased.
The results will not be seen in eight days.
The effect is visible only after a fortnight of lockdown.
Only then does it help to break the chain.
We will have to wait a few days for the results to appear.
Corona also happens from wedding ceremonies, political gatherings, why there are no restrictions on them?
Weddings and political gatherings should be closed completely.
Marriage to 50 people should also be canceled.
Marriages, political events can be avoided or postponed.
Postponing weddings and political events for a few months will not make any difference.
Why is the spread of corona increasing rapidly?
Mutations of the corona virus have occurred in Maharashtra and that is why it is spreading on a large scale, said former state president of IMA, Dr. Avinash Bhondwe expressed this while talking to BBC Marathi.
Currently, there is a double mutation in the corona virus.
Its spread has more than doubled.
At the same time, the symptoms of the corona have changed.
Redness, itching, and diarrhea are new symptoms.
People between the ages of 20 and 25 are more likely to be infected. "
Does closing the shop stop the spread of corona?
Contact tracing is not done properly.
There should be contact tracing of 20 people for a positive patient, it is only five at present.
Therefore, the spread is increasing due to asymptomatic patients, Said Bhondwe.
Trade electronically
If the shops open, there will be crowds and so the corona is likely to spread.
Bhondwe also thinks that the spread of corona can be reduced if traders continue to trade using electronic methods, such as home delivery or making appointments to specific people at specific times.
Mumbai Municipal Corporation will do 8 things to prevent corona
The prevalence of corona is increasing rapidly in Mumbai and Maharashtra.
Mumbai Municipal Corporation, the most populous city in Maharashtra, is taking steps to curb corona.
Mumbai Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal while giving information about this, said what will be emphasized by the Municipal Corporation.
The Mumbai Municipal Commissioner said that priority will be given to save the lives of patients.
At present, there are 325 additional beds available in Mumbai and now there are a total of 2466 ICU beds, Chahal said.
Mumbai Municipal Corporation will do 8 things to prevent corona:
Nodal officers will be appointed in 24 wards, special attention will be given especially from 11 pm to 7 am
At night mainly all the beds will be given in Jumbo Hospital
If a patient who calls at night does not have a covid report or is not tested, they will also be given a bed as a suspect
Try to stabilize if oxygen is needed
Labs are instructed to report within 24 hours
Preference should be given to reports of symptoms
Instructions for setting up Covid Care Center in Four and Five Star Hotels
1100 beds and 125 ICU beds will be made available in next 7 days
In the next 5-6 weeks, 3 Jumbo Centers will be set up with 2000 beds, 200 ICUs and 70 per cent oxygen beds.
Meetings from Uddhav Thackeray, what will be the decision and when?
Given the growing prevalence of corona in Maharashtra, clear indications have been given by the state government to impose lockdown.
However, it is not yet clear when the lockdown will be announced.
Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray held a meeting of all party leaders in Maharashtra on April 10, followed by a meeting with the task force set up on the occasion of Corona on April 11.
Today (April 12), the Chief Minister is expected to take stock of the economic situation by interacting with the state finance ministry.
As the number of corona patients in Maharashtra is increasing by 50,000, the Chief Minister is discussing with everyone to impose more stringent restrictions or to check the option of lockdown.
However, it is unknown at this time what he will do after leaving the post.
In an all-party meeting on April 10, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said, The number of patients is increasing so fast that if no decision is taken today, the situation will automatically be like tomorrow.
Important meeting with the task force
The task force meeting discussed issues related to availability of oxygen, use of remedicivir, availability of beds, treatment modalities, enhancement of facilities, imposition of restrictions, strict punitive action.
The meeting was attended by Health Minister Rajesh Tope, Medical Education Minister Amit Deshmukh, Chief Secretary Sitaram Kunte, Task Force's Dr. Sanjay Oak, Dr. Shashank Joshi, Dr. Avinash Supe, Dr. Tatyarao Lahane, Principal Secretary Health Dr. Pradeep Vyas, Medical Education Secretary Sourav Vijay were present.
'Creation of SOP started'
In a meeting of the task force, the Chief Minister said, "Over the last year, we have been fighting Kovidis to increase facilities, increase tests, raise awareness on large-scale health regulations.
There is also awareness among the people.
Basically, the number of patients is increasing rapidly.
Asymptomatic people are spreading the disease among the people.
People who follow the health rules are at risk due to careless people, lockdown should be stopped," he said.
Methods (SOP) will be prepared, "said the Chief Minister.
"Now we are in the forefront of vaccination but we will speed up and vaccinate as many people as possible. But this vaccination will be useful to prevent the third wave coming in the near future.
What did Rajesh Tope say after the task force meeting?
The lockdown situation has arisen in the state, said Health Minister Rajesh Tope while talking to media.
An important meeting between Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and the Covid Task Force Committee was held today (April 11). 
The meeting discussed the Corona situation in the state.
Speaking to media after the meeting, Rajesh Tope said, "The situation of lockdown is now prevailing in the state, so how to deal with the lockdown situation, how to solve any problem of the people, how many days if lockdown is to be imposed." He said, "Of course, all this has only been discussed.
But the lockdown situation has arisen in the state.
The members of the task force were of the view that the Chief Minister will now discuss with the Finance and other departments. . "
Corona Virus: Why is there a shortage of Remedesivir in Maharashtra?
The central government announced the second wave of corona in Maharashtra.
The number of corona patients has gone from hundreds to thousands and now to millions.
Again patients are feeling the lack of beds, ventilators, oxygen in the hospital.
Along with this deficiency, there is a great shortage of 'Remedesivir' injections.
The state government estimates that the state is currently experiencing an increase in the supply of about 50,000 remedesivir injections per day due to the growing number of corona patients.
If the number of patients continues to grow, 1.5 lakh injections a day may be required by the end of April.
As a result, the production of these injections is declining.
Why is this injection given?
Why is its production declining?
How is Remedesivir black marketed?
What is the condition of people without these injections?
This report ..
What is Remedesivir?
Remedesivir injection is considered to be effective in patients with corona infection.
It was recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an effective remedy for Covid-19 patients.
This injection was allowed to be used in Maharashtra from 30 June 2020.
Cipla (Mumbai), Hetro Healthcare (Hyderabad), Jubilant Lifesciences (Delhi), Ilia Laboratories (Argentina), Dr. Reddycevir injections of six companies namely Reddy's (Hyderabad), Zydus Cadila (Ahmedabad) are being used in Maharashtra.
This injection is given to a patient with a more serious infection as it affects the corona patients.
J. J. The head of the hospital's pharmacology team, Dr. Madhukar Gaikwad says, "Corona infection occurs in the lungs.
HRCT is used to check the extent of the infection.
It has a score.
A score of 5 out of 25 is not considered serious.
Infected patients are given Remedesivir injection.
There is no age condition.
Those who are more infected are given the injection.
However, it is not given to pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers.
What are the reasons for the shortage?
Remedesivir injection is currently supplied by 6 companies.
There are 4 companies that supply more.
The raw material required for this injection has to be imported.
It is not available in India.
Therefore, the process of production from import of raw materials is huge.
Sushil Mali, district organizer of the Maharashtra Registered Drug Dealers Association (MRPS), says, "For the last several days, there has been no supply of Remedesivir injections.
"Where there is a demand for 500 injections, there is a supply of 60-70 injections in two days.
Some companies do not supply these private hospitals.
Therefore, the demand for these injections has increased from the relatives of the patients treated in private hospitals.
He further says, "This injection can be stored for 6 months.
Now the limit has been increased to 12 months.
But earlier it could not be stored as there was a limit of 6 months."
The injection is given to a person with a serious infection of the corona.
However, the state government has observed that in some hospitals, patients who do not have symptoms or do not need them are being given remedicivir injections.
What is the state government doing in this regard?
State Health Minister Rajesh Tope said, "The injection molding companies have started increasing production.
It will take at least 20 days to complete the process.
After that, there will be no shortage of remedesivir in the state.
We have agreed to supply stocks to Maharashtra.
At the same time, 70% of the company's products are being supplied to Maharashtra. "
'Remedesivir injection of 40 thousand'
My 74-year-old mother contracted corona.
The lung infection was very high.
The doctor advised her to be admitted to the hospital immediately ...
a person living in Navi Mumbai told BBC Marathi.
He further said, "I took my mother to a hospital in Dombivli.
The doctors started injecting remedicivir.
We got the injection on the first day but the next day the hospital asked us to give the injection.
So I went around.
Despite the black market, my mother's health was important to me, so I bought five such remedicivir injections at Rs 40,000 for Rs 8,000 and completed my mother's treatment. "
The story of the householders living in Pune was similar.
He described his brother's condition on condition of anonymity.
His 42-year-old brother was hospitalized.
The HRCT test score was 12 out of 25.
The doctor told him that he needed to be given 6 injections of remedivir.
I visited all the reputed hospitals in Pune.
I could not find any remedicavir anywhere.
I went to Poona Hospital for injections.
There was a queue of 150-200 people like me.
Then I bought the injections from a chemist for 2200 and 3000.
Trying to stop the black market?
The state health department has said that remedesivir injection should be sold for Rs 1,100 to Rs 1,400.
But that doesn't seem to be happening.
One injection is available on the black market at Rs 4,000 to Rs 8,000.
The Food and Drug Administration has launched raid sessions to stop the massive black market.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has appealed to the concerned district administration to call the toll free number 1800-222-365 if any patient is not getting Remedesivir injection or if it is being black marketed.
Food and Drug Administration Minister Rajendra Shingane has directed the authorities to take stern action against the black marketeers.
Is Maharashtra being harmed in the case of Corona vaccine?
Vaccination has created a conflict between the Maharashtra government and the central government.
On the other hand, it was time to stop vaccination in many districts of the state.
The Maharashtra government claims that the Center is treating Maharashtra as a scapegoat, this is a call of the state government and now the state leaders are arguing over the cause of the vaccine due to the failure to control the infection.
The state government claims that Maharashtra is not getting vaccinated compared to the speed of vaccination, the affected population and the total population.
The central government says that Maharashtra has been given the highest number of vaccines in the country.
But when such allegations are rebutted, the numbers tell the truth.
First 7 lakhs, then 17 lakhs
Vaccines are supplied to every state by the Central Government across the country and vaccination program is implemented as per the rules laid down by the Center.
Every week the stock is given to the states by the central government for selected days.
The Maharashtra government claims that the number of vaccines given to Maharashtra this week is meager.
The BJP-ruled states have been given more, while Maharashtra, where the infection is highest, has been given less.
The distribution figures of vaccines produced by Covishield, a serum institute, for the period April 15 to April 20, shed light on this information.
According to the schedule, Madhya Pradesh has the highest supply of vaccines at 33.76,220, Uttar Pradesh at 44,98,450, West Bengal at 21,05,970, Haryana at 24,68,920 and Karnataka at 29,06,240.
It was planned to supply 7,43,280 vaccines to Maharashtra for this period.
A comparison of the positive cases on the government's website and the planned supply figures shows that Maharashtra's supply was less planned than other states during this period.
From the figures, it seems that those who had more supply planned, except Bengal, are ruled by BJP.
But in Maharashtra, where the number of infections is increasing rapidly, there is a shortage of vaccines.
The Maharashtra government has openly expressed its displeasure.
Such a colorful struggle between the center and the state
As the supply of vaccine to Maharashtra was declining, the state leaders were demanding that the central government send stocks of vaccine as soon as possible.
Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Wednesday (April 7) criticized the Maharashtra government for not being serious about the Corona health crisis while raising the issue of vaccine shortage.
Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan issued a press release in this regard.
In it, he said, "While witnessing the corona virus, I have personally witnessed the mismanagement and pertinent attitude of the Maharashtra government.
The Central Government regularly counseled the Government of Maharashtra on the background of Corona.
Provided them with all the resources.
He also sent central teams to help.
But now it is clear that there is a lack in the efforts of the Maharashtra government itself, said Harshvardhan.
On Thursday, April 8, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray again raised the issue of vaccines in a meeting of the Prime Minister with all the Chief Ministers.
Sharad Pawar also had a talk with Union Health Minister Dr. Harshvardhan.
The controversy between Maharashtra and the Center was discussed all over the country.
Then on Thursday night the immunization department of the health ministry announced revised planning.
Accordingly, Maharashtra was given 10 lakh stocks of additional vaccines.
Accordingly, the state will now receive 17,43,280 vaccines for this week.
Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope also informed about it.
But considering the need and speed of vaccination, Maharashtra has demanded 40 lakh vaccines per week from the Center.
Most vaccinations and immunizations in Maharashtra
On the other hand, the central government and BJP leaders in the states have categorically denied that there is any harm in Maharashtra.
According to him, Maharashtra has the highest supply of vaccines than any other state.
He has criticized the allegations that Maharashtra is being harmed only because it is a non-BJP government.
Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Devendra Fadnavis said in a tweet on Thursday that "only three states have been given more than one crore vaccines till date: Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan.
Gujarat and Rajasthan have the same population and in Rajasthan the Congress is in power."
The supply of vaccines depends not only on the population but also on the effectiveness of vaccination in the state.
The Maharashtra Directorate of Information said in a tweet on April 6 that the state had received 1.06 crore vaccines.
91 lakh out of which was given.
Statistics also confirm that most vaccinations have been done in Maharashtra.
According to the latest figures on the Union Health Ministry's website and the 'Covin' portal, 93,93,352 people have been vaccinated in Maharashtra till noon on April 9.
Rajasthan is second only to Maharashtra in vaccinating 88 lakh people.
But in the supply phase from which the controversy started, the states that have received the most vaccines are lagging behind in terms of statistical performance.
81.4 lakh people have been vaccinated in Uttar Pradesh, 52.34 lakh in Madhya Pradesh, 54.63 lakh in Karnataka and 84.75 lakh in Gujarat.
If performance is determined by vaccination statistics and supply is based on performance, then these official figures tell a different story.
But the state is also at loggerheads over the issue of wastage of vaccine.
Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said that 6 per cent vaccine was wasted in Maharashtra.
However, Rajesh Tope tweeted that the number given by Javadekar is the national average and the rate of vaccine wastage in Maharashtra is less than half of the national average.
Corona vaccine: What happens if the second dose of vaccine is delayed?
Health Minister Rajesh Tope's announcement that there are not enough stocks of vaccine available in Maharashtra has raised many questions about the second dose of vaccine.
Health Minister Rajesh Tope said that there is enough stock of corona vaccine available in Maharashtra till April 9-10.
He said, "On Wednesday (April 7), 14 lakh vaccines were available. Today, there are 9 lakh vaccines left.
After April 15, 17 lakh vaccines will be available.
That quantity is also low."
Vaccination started in the country from 16th January 2021.
The vaccine needs to be taken in two doses for the body to produce antibodies and for the vaccine to be effective.
The Central Health Department has also clarified that the second dose is expected to be taken six to eight weeks after the first dose of the vaccine.
However, what to do if the person who took the first dose of the vaccine did not get the second dose in time due to lack of vaccine?
Can it have any effect on health?
If a second dose is not obtained, will the antibodies needed to fight the corona virus not be produced?
If the second dose is not received in time, where should I report it?
And if the first dose is taken with one vaccine, and the vaccine is not available, but the second is available, should the second dose be given with a different vaccine?
We will try to find out the answers to these questions from experts.
1. If the first vaccine is taken but the second vaccine (second dose of vaccine) is not available or not available within a period of six to eight weeks, can it have any effect on health?
It has been two and a half months since vaccination started in the country.
From April 1, all citizens in India over the age of 45 will also be vaccinated.
As a result, a large number of citizens were vaccinated.
Health Minister Rajesh Tope clarified that now there is a shortage of vaccine.
Therefore, citizens are skeptical about getting a second dose of the vaccine.
WHO, Washington Post praises Maharashtra - Rajesh Tope
The second vaccine (second dose of vaccine) is to be given about six to eight weeks after the first vaccination.
But if this period is reversed and the vaccine is not available, there is no reason to panic, say medical experts from the state health department.
The survey officer of the state health department, Dr. Speaking to BBC Marathi, Pradip Awate said, "Even if the second vaccine is not received in time, it will not affect the health.
Therefore, citizens should not worry about it.
But it is very important to get another vaccine." Even so, he clarified.
But such a situation does not exist in Maharashtra, claims the director of the Maharashtra Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER), Tatyarao Lahane has done it.
He also said that getting the first vaccine and not getting the second vaccine does not happen.
Speaking to BBC Marathi, Dr Tatyarao Lahane said, "Even if we do not get a second dose of vaccine, it will not affect our health.
Currently there is some stock of vaccine and there will be a supply of vaccines in the coming days.
So there is no reason to worry, he said.
A second vaccine is automatically provided for the first vaccinated person, said Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the State Action Force (Corona Task Force), head of the College of Physicians and a senior diabetic, while speaking to BBC Marathi.
He said, "There is no shortage of second doses.
The government has reserved a second dose for the first dose.
So I think this fear is artificial.
Even in rural areas, such a situation will not arise for a second dose."
Also, according to the World Health Organization, the second dose of the vaccine should be given in two or three months, he said.
2. What happens if I do not get or take the second dose of vaccine?
Adequate and sufficient antibodies are needed in the body to fight the corona virus.
Dr. Pradeep Awate says, "Without a second vaccine, the body will not produce enough antibodies.
Therefore, the vaccine will not have as much effect on the body as it should to fight the virus.
In short, just one vaccine will not be effective."
He adds, "According to the information we have received so far, the covshield vaccine provides 71 percent protection from the corona.
But this protection is obtained after taking both doses of the vaccine."
3. Where to complain if I do not get a second dose of vaccine?
There is no denying the possibility of difficulty getting a second dose of the vaccine in the near future.
This is because the administration is saying that the stock of vaccine has run out in many districts or it is insufficient.
If you do not get a second dose of the vaccine, you should report it to the relevant vaccination center.
You are expected to get a second vaccine at the same place where the first vaccine was given.
You should then go to the same center and get vaccinated.
That is what Dr. Pradeep Awate says.
Dr. Shashank Joshi says that you can also report on the Covin (Co-WIN) app used for registration or appointment for vaccines.
The Covin app has all the information and contacts about the vaccine.
You can use it to register your complaint. Even so, he said.
4. If the first dose is of one vaccine, and the vaccine is not available, but the second is available, should the second dose be of a different vaccine?
Experts from the health department clarified that this cannot be done and there is no such provision.
Dr. Pradeep Awate, Survey Officer, Health Department, said, "Two doses of vaccine cannot be given by different companies.
The first dose is for one vaccine and the second dose is not for another company.
Therefore, citizens should not do this."
Dr. Shashank Joshi, a member of the State Action Committee, clarified that such facility is not available even at the vaccination centers.
Uddhav Thackeray demanded these things from Narendra Modi to fight Corona
Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should give an understanding to the political parties not to bring any politics in the Corona fight.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi today (April 8) interacted with the Chief Ministers of the states through video conferencing.
Union Health Minister Dr. due to the shortage of vaccines in the state. Harshvardhan alleged that the Mahavikas Alliance government failed to handle the situation in Corona.
Due to this, the match between the state government and the central government was played all day long.
Against this backdrop, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said that Maharashtra was nowhere behind to fight the Corona and demanded that politics should not be allowed to take place on these issues.
Uddhav Thackeray has demanded that 40 lakh vaccines be supplied to Maharashtra every week.
Uddhav Thackeray also demanded that the central government supply vaccines as per demand and provide oxygen and ventilators.
Uddhav Thackeray also said that the Center should approve the proposal sent by the state government to the Halfkin Institute to produce the vaccine as soon as possible.
What has increased the number of patients in Maharashtra?
Of the total tests conducted in the state so far, 71 per cent have been RTPCR and 28 per cent antigen tests.
However, the Union Health Secretary has suggested that the government increase the number of tests.
Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray admitted that Corona's support has increased in Maharashtra due to Gram Panchayat elections and weddings.
He said, "In the mean time, we managed to stem the tide of infection.
At that time, there were only 3,000 patients in Maharashtra.
Maharashtra, like all other major states, took care of it.
The whole family became infected. "
While the situation in the state is becoming normal, the infection has increased due to mutations in the virus.
The experience is the same all over the world.
Uddhav Thackeray also asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to increase the number of RTPCR tests to more than 70 per cent and speed up vaccination but with the help of the central government.
'Supply vaccine on demand'
Uddhav Thackeray has demanded that 40 lakh vaccines be supplied to Maharashtra every week.
He also said that the objective is to vaccinate about 1.77 crore people in the priority group in the state.
So far, the state has received 1 crore 6 lakh 23 thousand 500 doses.
Also, 92 to 95 lakh doses have been given till date.
However, at present, Maharashtra has very few stocks and some vaccination centers are closed, said Uddhav Thackeray.
It was also demanded that 17.43 lakh doses be given after April 15, as the central government had said, and that the vaccination drive would be hampered, so that full distribution should be done simultaneously as per our demand.
The demand to vaccinate everyone above 25 years was also mentioned.
Also need oxygen, ventilator and remedivir
The state is in dire need of oxygen and the central government has been asked to supply it.
Given the current number of coronary heart disease patients, the demand for oxygen is estimated at 1700-2500 MT by the end of April.
Therefore, to keep the supply smooth, it is urgent to supply liquid medical oxygen to Maharashtra, said Uddhav Thackeray.
The meeting also demanded supply of remedivasir from drug manufacturers across the country and control of the price of the drug by the drug controller.
About 50 to 60 thousand bottles of Remedesivir are in use in Maharashtra.
Given the number of active patients, this need could increase to 90,000 to 1 lakh bottles per day by the end of April.
The ICMR has asked the central government to make a rule on the use of remedicivir and stop the export of the drug as remedicivir is being given only to CT scanned patients in many places.
It was also demanded that another 1,200 ventilators be provided in the state.
The ventilators ordered by the Center were said to be closed due to technical reasons.
The state government has set up Hafkin Biopharmaceutical Corporation Ltd.
The Parel-based organization has sent a proposal to the central government to produce covacin.
Uddhav Thackeray also said that it should be accepted as soon as possible so that the vaccine can be supplied.
Detailed details of Maharashtra
As on March 1, 2021, 75,000 tests were being conducted every day in the state.
The same number has gone up to more than 2 lakh tests in the last 3 days.
Currently, 1.25 lakh RTPCR tests are being conducted daily.
On April 7, 2 lakh 35 thousand 749 tests were conducted in the state, which included 1 lakh 33 thousand 344 RTPCRs and 1 lakh 2 thousand 405 antigens.
The death rate among corona patients in the state was 1.69 per cent in January, 0.82 per cent in February and 0.37 per cent in March.
From April 1 to April 7, the mortality rate is 0.55 per cent with 3 lakh 60 thousand 281 patients.
At present there are 5 lakh 1 thousand 559 active patients in the state.
60% of patients are in home segregation and 40% in institutional segregation.
4.32 percent of active patients are on oxygen while less than 1 percent of patients are on ventilators.

Oxygen beds are 32.77 per cent full, ICU beds are 60.95 per cent full and at present 33.97 per cent ventilators are installed.
Uddhav Thackeray government is ignoring Corona for recovery- Dr. Harshavardhana
The shortage of vaccines in Maharashtra has started a new controversy against the central government and the state's Mahavikas Aghadi government.
Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan has criticized the Maharashtra government for not being serious about the Corona health crisis.
Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan has issued a press release in this regard .
I have personally witnessed the mismanagement and pertinent attitude of the Maharashtra government in the fight against the corona virus.
The lack of a state government has hit the entire country's anti-corona campaign, he said.
What exactly did the Union Health Minister say?
The Central Government regularly counseled the Government of Maharashtra on the background of Corona.
Provided them with all the resources.
He also sent central teams to help.
But now it is clear that there is a lack in the efforts of the Maharashtra government itself, said Harshvardhan.
He also blamed the government for the increase in the number of patients and death rate in Maharashtra.
He said, "Today, Maharashtra has the highest number of corona patients and deaths in the country.
Not only that, but Maharashtra also has the highest number of positive cohort tests in the world.
In this press release, he also targeted Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray.
The government's performance is not good even for health workers and essential service workers.
The government is giving relief from institutional quarantine for personal recovery.
It is shocking to see that this is increasing the risk to the people of Maharashtra.
Overall, the state is stuck in one crisis after another.
It looks like.
He made such a criticism.
'... then vaccination has to be stopped'
As the supply of vaccine to Maharashtra is declining, the central government is demanding that the central government send stocks of vaccine as soon as possible.
Health Minister Rajesh Tope has admitted that there is a shortage of anti-covid vaccines in the state.
"The state has enough stocks of vaccines for three days.
If the vaccines are not received in three days, vaccination will stop," Tope told reporters.
The second wave of Covid-19 caused a blast of corona infection in Maharashtra.
At present, there are more than 4 lakh 70 thousand active corona patients in the state.
Vaccination has been stopped in some districts of the state due to non-availability of vaccine.
Corona infection is spreading rapidly across the state.
The mini-lockdown has been caused by the spread of corona infection in urban and rural areas.
Out of 10 Covid-19 hotspot districts in the country, 7 districts are in Maharashtra.
Therefore, Maharashtra has become a hotspot for corona infection in the country.
Corona Mumbai: After finding so many patients, the society will become a micro-containment zone?
A micro containment zone is being set up in Mumbai to curb the growing contagion of corona virus and the rules for the same have been announced by the Mumbai Municipal Corporation.
Rules for micro containment zones

Maharashtra Lockdown: What exactly are the restrictions for private offices?
In Maharashtra, the second wave of corona has started very fast and intensely.
Yesterday (March 4) in one day 57 thousand patients were found in Maharashtra.
It also shows the intensity of the wave.
To curb the second wave of corona, the Maharashtra government has imposed some restrictions from today (March 5), calling it a 'break the chain'.
Even though restrictions have been imposed, there is still some confusion among many.
Many have questioned the rules on social media, especially with regard to private establishments.
We are going to remove this confusion.
Let us understand in detail exactly what the government has said in its order regarding the new restrictions.
Private offices
The Maharashtra government's order on restrictions has clearly given some instructions under the separate heading 'Offices'.
It said all private offices would remain closed except for the following.
Co-operative Banks, Public Sector Banks and Private Banks
BSE and NSE
Companies related to power supply
Telecom service provider
Airlines and Mediclaim companies
Pharmaceutical company offices for production and distribution management
The Maharashtra government has made it clear that except for the above six things, private offices will remain closed.
The last instruction in the same headline says that employees in private and government offices should be vaccinated immediately as per government norms.
So that the government can resume offices.
Factory and manufacturing unit
The manufacturing sector is important for private sector jobs, including private offices.
Let's see what the restrictions are.
The manufacturing sector, the manufacturing sector, can continue with certain rules, the government said in the order. Then the following rules are applied to it:
Before admitting any worker to the factory and manufacturing unit, his body temperature should be measured.
All employees from managerial level should be vaccinated as per government norms.
If a worker / employee is found to be corona positive, all employees who come in contact with him should be quarantined.
Factories with more than 500 employees should set up their own quarantine facility.
If an employee is found to be corona positive, the unit concerned should be shut down until it is completely sanitized.
Divide between lunch and break times, so that there will be no crowds.
The dining area should not be combined.
Common toilet facilities should be kept clean.
All workers should be vaccinated as per government norms.
Also, a negative RTPCR report will be accepted for 15 days.
This rule will be effective from 10 April 2021.
If an employee is infected with corona, he should be given medical leave.
He should not be fired.
Construction area
Another important sector for private sector workers is construction.
The government has laid down some rules for construction under a separate heading.
Workers on the construction site where they live are allowed to continue working on the site.
However, if some things need to be taken in or out, then the work has to be stopped.
It also does not prohibit the import of material.
All workers working on construction sites should be vaccinated as per government norms.
Also, a negative RTPCR report will be accepted for 15 days.
This rule will be effective from 10 April 2021.
If the rules are not followed, the developer will be fined Rs 10,000.
If the same mistakes are made again, the site will be shut down.
If a worker is found to be corona positive, he or she should be granted paid medical leave.
He cannot be fired.
Meanwhile, some private office work now takes place from home, from work to home.
But there are many offices whose work cannot be done from home.
The question of what they want to do remains unanswered.
BBC Marathi spoke to Vikas Satpute, a human resource officer at a BPO company in Mumbai.
According to him, "Work from a company like BPO is not possible because there is constant monitoring of employees.
The work is done according to the target.
Not only BPOs, but there are many companies where work from is not possible, Satpute told the BBC.
Corona: What is Home Quarantine? What to do to prevent others from being infected with the corona virus?
Patients with non-coronary symptoms and mild symptoms are allowed to undergo 'home quarantine'.
The state government has published new rules for this.
What exactly is a home quarantine?
And what to take care of after home quarantine?
Everyone has this question.
Let us know the answers to these questions.
Where did the word 'quarantine' come from?
The 14th century was plagued by plague in many parts of the world.
During this time many boats from all over the world entered the port of Venice.
No one on board was diagnosed with a plague or other contagious disease during these 40 days, and only then were the sailors allowed to disembark.
The original Italian word 'quarantine' means - 40, and hence the word 'quarantine'.
The same word is constantly ringing in our ears.
Patients infected with corona are quarantined.
For this, the government has set up quarantine centers in various places.
But with this, the government has started offering the option of home isolation or home quarantine.
But who exactly is quarantined or isolated at home?
What care should be taken while doing this?
If someone becomes a home quarantine, is there any danger to others in the house?
This is what we are going to learn.
What exactly is quarantine and isolation?
In Marathi, 'quarantine' is called segregation and isolation is called segregation.
Quarantine is performed on individuals who have come in contact with corona patients and who have mild or very mild symptoms.
Asymptomatic patients, whose reports are positive, are treated with mild symptoms or asymptomatic patients with no symptoms at all.
Why are these people kept apart?
No one else should be infected with the corona virus, so these people are isolated.
It is a contagious disease.
It can be spread by microscopic snowflakes while speaking, sneezing or coughing.
That is why this cowardly suspect or infected person needs to be isolated.
On the one hand, the number of patients is increasing, but on the other hand, the central government has changed the rules of quarantine.
Patients with or without mild symptoms have the option of having a separate room, separate toilet at home if they have the necessary facilities at home.
This requires the consent of the patient and you need to fill out an affidavit.
Government of Maharashtra Rules for Home Isolation
Asymptomatic means that patients with no symptoms, no comorbidities but mild corona symptoms can be isolated at home.
The patient needs to be medically certified to have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all.
Even if a person with senile age or comorbidities does not show symptoms of corona, a decision about home isolation will be made after consultation with the person's family doctor.
This patient needs to be cared for at home day and night.
There should be a communication system (telephone, mobile) between the caregiver and the treating hospital.
A corona positive person will have to answer a phone call from the municipal or health system, IVR.
Caregivers and all close family members should take hydroxychloroquine in accordance with the protocol of medical authorities.
It is mandatory to inform the patient to the team coming for the survey at home.
The person being isolated should have a pulse oximeter, thermometer, face mask, gloves, sanitizer.
What should a person with a home quarantine do?
If it is not possible to be alone in a room full time, the most important thing is to stay away from senior citizens in the house, pregnant women, children and other people with comorbidities.
Personal Hygiene - Follow hygiene, and take medications on time.
Do not take any medicine without doctor's advice.
Limit your activities at home.
Use a mask at home.
Don't mix with people by mistake, don't go out of the house.
If you live alone in a room, try to follow your routine.
And keep the mind engaged.
Next, let's look at what a home quarantine person or caregiver is expected to do.
The Department of Health, Government of India has issued some guidelines in this regard.
This home isolation option is offered only to patients who are being cared for at home.
That is why the role of this caregiver is important.
Everything used by the patient should be different.
Keep their dinner plate separate.
Wash patient's clothes, dishes, cups, bedsheets, towels separately.
When feeding the patient, use masks and gloves when cleaning the room.
Dispose of it properly after one use.
Only one person in the family should take care of this patient.
If the patient is experiencing mild symptoms, it is difficult to see if the symptoms are getting worse.
If the patient has difficulty breathing, chest pain, loss of appetite, blue face or lips, seek immediate medical attention, visit the hospital.
Start taking hydroxychloroquine on the advice of medical authorities.
The patient's room should be cleaned daily with a solution of 1% sodium hypochlorite, and the toilet and other surfaces should be cleaned with a solution of bleach.
Exactly how many days do you want to stay in Home Quarantine?
You need to observe home quarantine for 17 days from the onset of symptoms.
The sample for testing should be counted for 17 days from the day it was taken and then for 10 consecutive days if there is no fever, the person is exempted from home segregation.
The guidelines issued by the Maharashtra government state that there is no need to re-test the home quarantine period.
When to go to the hospital?
Monitor the health of the person in isolation at home.
If this person starts having problems, contact a doctor immediately.
Contact a doctor if you find these :
Difficulty breathing
Pulse Oximeter - A finger-level oxygen level monitor if the level is below 95
Fever over 100.40 Fahrenheit (38 C) for 24 hours
Fatigue after 6 minutes of walking
Feeling of constant chest pain or pressure
Sensation of face or limbs
Feeling confused, having trouble speaking
Blue scars on face or lips
How to maintain mental health?
Even if the patient is at home during home quarantine or isolation, he and others in the household may experience stress, experts say.
Renowned psychiatrist Dr. Speaking to BBC Marathi, Manoj Bhatwadekar said, "If we want to maintain mental health in this time, it is important to keep the mind in the present as much as possible.
For this, a good daily routine should be followed, including adequate diet, adequate sleep, and adequate exercise.
But there are also some things to avoid.
It is true that the spread of the disease is increasing the tension.
About this Dr. Manoj Bhatwadekar said, "A person who is cowardly positive is the physical condition of that person.
Positive people have fear, anxiety, we can infect others, it makes them feel guilty.
Mumbai: 'What to eat if there is a lockdown?' Foreign laborers waited for the village
Seeing the growing number of corona patients in Maharashtra, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, while interacting with the people on April 2, had said, "I am warning you of a complete lockdown."
According to this, there was a discussion today whether there would be lockdown in Maharashtra.
The possibility of a lockdown shocked some foreign workers in Mumbai and they decided to return to their hometowns.
This includes workers from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal.
When we reached the Lokmanya Tilak terminus in Mumbai around 2 pm, we saw hundreds of laborers.
The group was marching towards the station with bags in their hands and backs.
One of these was Khalilullah Khan.
They met us just outside the main entrance of Lokmanya Tilak Terminus.
He says he decided to return to the village as soon as he understood the lockdown.
He said, "I drive a rickshaw in Mumbai.
Besides, in the current situation, people don't go out of the house, so there's no business at all.
Sudhir Chauhan was standing on the outer wall of Lokmanya Terminus with a torn bag in his hand.
After talking to him, it was learned that he had come to Mumbai from Kolkata for labor a month and a half ago.
Now due to the increase in Corona patients and strict restrictions, their work has stopped.
After the lockdown, will you stay and eat in Mumbai?
At the same time, we saw five or six people rushing to the train station.
When he was asked why he was going to the village, Naseem replied, "Brother, I haven't had any work since last week.
Naseem and his colleagues make bags in Dharavi.
We talked to some people at the station, but there were many people who had built their world and were on their way to the village.
Meanwhile, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar has clarified that if the time comes to impose lockdown, we will give two days.
He was speaking after a Corona status review meeting chaired by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray.
He said, "Last time the Prime Minister imposed a sudden lockdown and the workers got stuck.
'Corona will not end soon' - WHO
Steroids can be controlled for a few months by taking steps for public health.
Even though 78 million doses of the corona vaccine have been given worldwide so far, this is not a sign that the outbreak is over, he said.
In December 2019, the corona virus spread around the world from the Chinese city of Wuhan.
According to Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyes, "Corona cases have been declining for six consecutive weeks in January and February.
During a conversation in Geneva, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyes said, "The vaccine is definitely an important weapon to fight the corona.
Social distance, the use of masks, frequent hand washing and a well-ventilated area are all effective against the disease.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyes said there is no similarity in the steps taken for public health.
People should stop thinking that corona is a simple flu, because the virus has killed young and healthy people, he said.
It is not yet clear whether the disease will have a far-reaching effect on those who become corona-free.
'Corona's support won't end there'
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyes, head of the World Health Organization, said: "The world has a number of reasons to keep hope alive.
Earlier this year (2021), the number of corona cases had decreased.
Given the pace at which vaccines are being produced globally, it is impossible for vaccines to reach all countries as quickly and uniformly as possible.
Corona vaccine: Blood clots after vaccination, young people under the age of 30 in Britain do not have the AstraZeneca vaccine
In Britain, young people under the age of 30 should not be vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine, but should be given an alternative vaccine, according to the MHRA, which regulates drugs.
The MHRA has made this suggestion after receiving complaints of blood clotting in some people after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine.
The MHRA studied vaccinations in the UK until the end of March.
It showed blood clots in 79 people who had been vaccinated against AstraZeneca.
However, there is no strong evidence that the AstraZeneca vaccine caused blood clots to form in these people, the MHRA said.
But, on the other hand, whether there is any connection between blood clots and vaccination is also being investigated.
Side effects of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine are extremely rare.
Notice of MHRA
According to MHRA, the vaccine will be beneficial for most people.
Also, people who have taken the first dose should take the second dose, MHRA said.
But those who have problems with blood clots should not take a second dose, the organization said.
Following the report of MHRA, the government advisory body JCVE also took steps in this regard.
The government has suggested that young people between the ages of 18 and 29 should be vaccinated with something other than AstraZeneca.

But the UK's drug regulators say the benefits of the vaccine are many times greater than the risks of the vaccine.
A spokesman for AstraZeneca said "the safety of patients is a top priority for the company."
But since then, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Canada have limited the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine to senior citizens.
According to figures released by the UK's drug regulator on Friday, there have been 22 cases of blood clots, such as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST).
At the same time, the platelets in the blood of these people had decreased.
Seven people have died in the UK, the UK's drug regulator has told the BBC via email.
The chief executive of the UK drug regulator MHRA, Dr. "The benefits of vaccines to prevent Covid 19 infections and the complications of vaccines are many times greater than the risks, and people should continue to get vaccinated when they have their turn," said Rein.
Did the AstraZeneca vaccine cause blood clots?
These types of rare blood clots are caused by the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is currently being investigated.
But two of these factors have raised doubts.
The vaccine may be one of the causes of these rare and isolated cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, but it is not yet clear.
The difference between Oxford - AstraZeneca and Pfizer - Bioentech vaccines, is another different issue.
There have been two cases of CVST after Pfizer vaccination in the UK.
Also, it is not clear how many people with ERV have blood clots in this way.
In Germany, 2.7 million people were vaccinated.
No data has been released on how many people in the UK have been affected.
A researcher told the BBC that there was growing evidence that the blood clots were linked to the vaccine.
Medical Microbiologist from East Anglia University Pvt.
But such incidents are rare, says Edinburgh University Public Health Expert Pvt.
Analysis by James Gallagher
All medicines, be they vaccines or paracetamol, are likely to have some side effects.
Guillain-Barre syndrome is also one in ten million people likely to be affected by the flu vaccine.
The question then becomes - is it really worth the risk?
It has not yet been proven that these problems are caused by vaccines.
But it is important to look at the dangers posed by the corona virus.
If 2.5 million people over the age of 60 became infected with the corona virus, about 50,000 lives would be lost.
The benefits and risks of the vaccine will continue to be studied as the vaccine for Covid 19 reaches a younger age.
Corona Vaccine: How to register for vaccination by downloading the Co-WIN app?
From April 1, all people over the age of 45 in the country will be vaccinated against covid.
Vaccination for Covid 19 was started in India from January 16 and from March 1, citizens above 60 years of age and citizens above 45 years of age with congenital heart disease were being vaccinated.
In the first phase, healthcare workers and frontline workers were vaccinated.
A digital platform called Co-Win has been developed for this vaccination campaign.
What is the Co-WIN app?
The Government of India has stated that the primary objective of this app is to help the system to monitor the vaccination program of Covid 19.
Coin (Co-WIN) is a digital platform for the Covid 19 vaccination campaign.
But there is some confusion over the name of this Co-WIN app.
How to download Coin (Co-WIN) app?
The Covin (Co-WIN) app is available for download in the App Store.
Who can register on the Covin (Co-WIN) app?
In the early stages of vaccination, the app could only be used by government officials and the health system.
For this, first you have to go to the website https://www.cowin.gov.in/home and register your mobile number.
After that you can register a total of 4 people on this one login.
When registering a person, his name, date of birth and Aadhar number or other identity card will have to be filled.
You can then book a vaccination slot.
You will need to have photo ID to register.
These documents can be used
Voter ID card
Aadhaar card
Driving license
PAN card
MGNREGA employment card
Bank or post office passbook
Passbook
Pension documents
The same identity card used during registration will have to be shown while going for vaccination.
How to book a slot for vaccination?
Login using the mobile number you registered on the portal.
You want to make an appointment by clicking on the calendar icon in front of these names.
After clicking on this mark you want to select the state.
This will include both government and private centers.
Where you have to pay for the vaccine, it will be written as Paid.
You can check which date slots are available by clicking on each of these centers.
When you go to get vaccinated on the day of this appointment, do not forget to bring along the identity card on which you have registered.
After taking the first dose of vaccine, you will get an sms telling you when to come and take the second dose.
How will the Coin (Co-WIN) app work?
This is a cloud based app designed for planning, implementation and monitoring of the vaccination campaign for Covid 19.
After registering for the vaccine through this app, the registrant will be provided the date, time and details of the vaccination center via SMS.
Since each person will have to take two doses of the vaccine, the app will also tell you when you want to come back after the first dose and take the second dose.
After taking both doses of the vaccine, the person will be given a certificate in the form of a QR code.
What are the five modules on the Covin app and what are they for?
The Covin (Co-WIN) app will have five modules - Management, Registration, Vaccination, Acknowledgment and Information.
People can register for vaccination through the registration module.
It will be an 'Administrator' module for vaccinating officers.
The information provided by the registrant can be verified by the vaccination module in the app and the status of the person can also be updated after vaccination.
QR code certificates will be generated through the 'Beneficiary Acknowledgment Module' for acknowledgment and an SMS will be sent to the person after vaccination.
With the help of 'Report' module, information on vaccination sessions - how many sessions were given, how many people were vaccinated and who did not come - can be reported to the authorities.
Corona vaccine: Covohax vaccine trials begin in India - Other Poonawala
Adar Poonawala, head of the Serum Institute, said testing of the covavax vaccine on corona has begun in India.
Covovax vaccine is being developed by NovaVax and Serum Institute.
The Serum Institute of India is producing Kovavax in a joint venture with Novavax.
The vaccine has been developed by US-based biotech company Novavax.
The company had released the information in January.
The vaccine is currently being tested in India and is expected to be available for vaccination by September, said Poonawala.
Covishield vaccine is currently being supplied to underdeveloped countries under the World Health Organization's Covax campaign.
What is genome sequencing?
The corona virus found in Britain has mutated.
The new virus is spreading at a rate of 70 per cent faster, according to the British government.
Genome sequencing is the process of identifying whether the genetic makeup of a virus has changed.
Positive passengers to have 'genome sequencing'
In the last few days, the Indian government has decided to 'genome sequencing' passengers returning from the UK.
While giving information about this, the member of the policy commission Dr. V. K. Paul said, "The study of samples that came for genome sequencing in experimental schools across the country has been started on the battlefield."
Passengers returning from the UK have been contacted in the last few days.
But how do researchers recognize that the virus has mutated?
What is genome sequencing?
Simply put, 'Every virus has a different genetic makeup.
The virus has its own DNA or RNA code.
Talking about this, pathologist Dr. Prasad Kulkarni says, "The virus has a specific genetic code.
Both old and new viruses are matched to find out if there is a change in the genetic makeup of the virus.
What are the benefits of genome sequencing?
Speaking to the BBC about genome sequencing, the Director General of the Central Government's Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Dr. Shekhar Mande says, "Whether the virus has mutated or not.
According to experts, there are four major benefits of genome sequencing.
1- How the virus is spreading.
2- Helps to find out if the vaccine available on the virus is effective
3- Can a new virus 'strain' infect a person?
4- It is useful to identify new viruses
We can do genome sequencing of passengers from the UK and corona positive.
Need Genome Surveillance?
Genome sequencing will be extended to India after the discovery of a new corona strain in the UK.
Speaking about 'genome' surveillance, Dr. "Genome surveillance is very much needed.
So, the member of the policy commission, Dr. Paul says, "The mutation in this strain is about the place where the virus enters the body's cells.
Current status of genome sequencing in India
In India, genome sequencing is done in two laboratories of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research.
A large number of genome sequencing has been done at the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) in Delhi.
The Director of IGIB, Dr. Anurag Agarwal told the BBC: "India has so far genome sequencing of 4,000 samples related to Covid-19.
Genome sequencing will help determine if there are new mutations in the virus.
Who will do the genome sequencing?
If this new virus is not found in India.
1- A certain percentage of corona positive patients
2- 100 percent positive passengers coming from abroad
3- Individuals re-infected after corona healing
4- Participants in the vaccine testing process
Genome sequencing should be done, says Dr. Agarwal has expressed.
Speaking on the situation in India, a member of the Policy Commission, Dr. V. K. "We are studying the structure of the virus in laboratories.
According to experts, genome sequencing takes 24-48 hours to run.
Samples are taken from the patient's nose.
What effect does the new virus 'strain' have on the vaccine?
A new strain of the corona virus is spreading rapidly, according to the British government.
Speaking on the occasion, Director General of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Dr. Shekhar Mande says, "This new strain will have no effect on the vaccine.
Is the new virus 'Superspader' in Britain?
Member of the Policy Commission Dr. According to Paul, "changes in the virus have increased the risk of infection.
Corona Lockdown: Did Narendra Modi discuss with anyone during the lockdown? - BBC Special Report
The BBC's exclusive review of what exactly happened on the occasion of the year-long announcement of the lockdown imposed on India by the Corona:
Seema Kumari has a small hotel in Simdega district of Jharkhand.
A sudden nationwide lockdown in the country changed his life.
Speaking to us, she said, "It's better to die than to live like this again.
Seema was not given any protective gear while working as a frontline health worker.
Reminiscing about the train journey, Seema says, "The government was prepared by an employee.
Background
Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a nationwide lockdown on March 24, 2020.
As many as 30 states and union territories, according to government data.
When Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the lockdown
The question here is whether there was a need for nationwide lockdown if different state governments had already implemented lockdown in their respective states.
In support of the nationwide lockdown imposed on March 24, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) had said, "There needs to be consistency in the implementation of various measures implemented across the country."
The Prime Minister himself is the chairman of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).
This means that the central government took responsibility by implementing a nationwide lockdown.
To find out the answer to this question, we contacted key organizations, government departments and state governments that were directly affected by the lockdown under the Right to Information Act, 2005.
However, a close investigation by the BBC revealed very little evidence.
On March 1, 2021, we approached the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to present the government's position on this issue.
Let us now learn about the key departments of the Central Government, especially the Ministries of Public Health and Economy.
On-record acknowledges that most of these departments did not have enough information or were contacted before the nationwide lockdown took effect.
So the important question is how the central government decided what Oxford University's 'Covid-19 Government Response Tracker' called the world's toughest lockdown.
This is because if the government agencies responsible for the factors that would have been affected by the severe lockdown are not aware of it, how will they help the citizens?
Health sector
Soon after the corona virus began to spread in Wuhan, on January 8, 2020, India began to take precautions.
In fact, during the two-and-a-half months between January 8 and March 24, the Prime Minister was told that "caste is paying attention to this issue".
The Prime Minister had said, "Prepare, but do not be afraid."
Then in February, preparations were underway for the visit of the then US President Donald Trump to India.
Despite assurances from the Prime Minister and the Health Minister, the number of corona victims in India continued to rise .
Then on March 5, 2020, the Health Minister told Parliament that " India has adequate stocks of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and N95 masks and adequate isolation beds in case of outbreak of the disease ".
On March 12, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Covid-19 a global epidemic.
Love Agarwal, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, had said, Are planned. "
And in spite of all this, when the number of corona victims in India was only 600 and 9 people died, the Center imposed a severe lockdown in just 12 days.
We asked the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare what role you played in planning this nationwide lockdown.
After this we contacted various important departments and institutions of the same ministry.
We first contacted the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS).
The BBC correspondent asked for information under the Right to Information Act
No issues related to the lockdown, which will take effect on March 24, 2020, were discussed with the organization.
Answers to questions asked by the BBC
The next center under the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is the National Center for Disease Control (NCDC).
The Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), an organization under the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, has been at the forefront of the fight against covid-19 since early last year.
RTI application
The organization was at the forefront of testing, developing protocols, studying viruses, and participating in vaccines.
At a time when corona infection was spreading in India, the head of ICMR's infectious diseases department, Dr. R. R. Gangakhedkar had told me, "It would be wrong to say that the lockdown was implemented without consulting anyone or giving anyone an idea.
We wrote to ICMR about this.
RTI application
There are few hospitals in India with excellent health facilities like the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi, which comes under the purview of the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
Even Indian Army doctors have been trying to contain this global epidemic from the very beginning.
RTI application process
He did not have any documents to show that he had discussed the matter with them before the lockdown.
Asked when AFMS was informed of the lockdown decision, he said, "The Prime Minister announced it through the media."
'Health administration in the dark'
Within a few days of the lockdown, there was an atmosphere of confusion and confusion.
Sameed Ahmed Farooqi works as a project manager in Delhi.
Information application
Farooqi said, "Most of the government helplines were closed at that time.
Fortunately, Farooqi's parents both returned home after treatment.
Economy
In his address to the nation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said, "There is no doubt that the country will have to pay the financial price of the lockdown.
The final stage of the RTI process
So, what was the 'price' of this lockdown?
So the price was too high.
The lockdown has led to a sharp rise in unemployment.
The lockdown has cost many jobs.
In February 2021, it was 6.9 percent.
However, there is no reason to rejoice, even if the unemployment rate is as high as it was before the lockdown, as it does not indicate a reduction in the number of unemployed.
One of these important criteria is India's employment rate.
Answer given by RBI under RTI
We also approached the Union Ministry of Finance through various departments such as Economic Affairs, Expenditure, Revenue, Financial Services.
Many applications initially made under RTI were forwarded by the Finance Ministry to the Home Ministry.
Finally, the Home Ministry had to clarify that this information has been requested from your departments.
This was followed by a reply from all these departments.
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council is a 'constitutional body'.
In view of the impact of the virus on the economy, the Prime Minister announced the setting up of a 'Covid-19 Economic Response Task Force' headed by the Finance Minister.
The task of this task force was to effectively implement all the measures taken to alleviate the financial difficulties.
No information has yet been provided by the Prime Minister's Office and the Finance Ministry despite an application under the Right to Information Act 2005.
We also approached the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the regulator of banks in India.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the capital market regulator, said, "SEBI has not been contacted regarding the implementation of the nationwide lockdown."
Similar responses were received from key ministries and departments like Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME), Ministry of Telecommunications, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Civil Aviation, Consumer Affairs.
According to policy analyst Priya Rajan Dash, 'India's economy has already slowed down.
After telling them the information we got, she said, "That's the way this government works."
Better planning could have been done.
Human cost
The most grim picture of the lockdown is the migrant workers returning to their homes in any case.
On 14 September 2020, the Union Ministry of Labor and Employment was asked to provide information in this regard.
Responding to this, the ministry said that more than 1 crore migrant workers have returned to their homes.
Migrant workers returning by road
The ministry also said that no statistics were available on how many workers died on the way home and how many migrant workers lost their jobs.
On the same day that the lockdown was announced, the Ministry of Labor and Employment ‘advised’ all States and Union Territories to use the funds sent for direct bank transfers for construction approvals.
What else did the ministry do?
In this regard, we contacted 45 different departments from the Chief Secretariat of the Ministry and sought information under RTI.
Preeti Singh is a volunteer with the Stranded Workers Action Network (SWAN).
She says, "Even if it's an exam, you prepare.
It was like an experiment in which we were all guinea pigs.
What do others have to say?
The BBC also contacted the offices of the president and vice president.
The reply sent by the President's Secretariat said, "No information is available in the relevant department of this Secretariat."
According to the Vice President's Office, the lockdown was announced through an order issued by the Union Home Ministry on March 24, 2020.
The reply from the Vice President's Office said, "The Secretariat has not contacted the Prime Minister's Office in this regard."
In 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the creation of the post of Chief of Defense Staff (CDS).
Coincidentally, the current CDS General Bipin Rawat held a press conference on May 1, 2020 and praised the performance of the Corona Warriors and announced that he would continue to support the Frontline Warriors.
We also asked their department if they had been informed about the lockdown and if anything related to it had been discussed.
In response, we were told, "No information available."
The Ministry of Manpower Development also said, "Whether the Prime Minister's Office consulted with the Department of Higher Education before announcing the lockdown and information on other related issues is not on record."
Corona: Lockdown of important ministries due to Narendra Modi's lockdown decision?
There is going to be a complete lockdown all over the country
Do you remember these words?
To stop the spread of this global epidemic and break the chain of transmission, on March 24, 2020, at 8 pm, Prime Minister Narendra Modi stopped working in India.
There were 519 patients of Covid-19 in the country that day and 9 died along with it.
Our government is working with the state governments and on the advice of experts, he said.
In fact, for more than two and a half months now - since the Government of India began monitoring the virus and preparing for a solution, the image has been that we are working together.
However, a thorough investigation by the BBC did not find much evidence that the consultation actually took place despite the drastic step of imposing a national lockdown.
We investigated this using the Right to Information Act, 2005, i.e. the Right to Information Act (RTI).
We contacted the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on March 1, 2021 to understand the government's position in this regard.
The majority responded that they had not been consulted before the implementation of the largest lockdown in the world, nor did they know that they would have a role in it.
So how did India take this decision and how was the government expected to help the citizens?
Let us first learn some references.
Announcement of lockdown in the country
The lockdown was announced on March 24, 2020, two months before that, in mid-January, when we were actively monitoring the spread of the corona virus and preparing a response, the Indian government said.
As India was preparing for the grand reception of the then US President Donald Trump, on 22 February 20202, the country’s Health Minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan further announced: "
As the number of patients gradually increased, Harsh Vardhan assured Parliament on March 5, 2020, " Stocks of personal protective equipment and N-95 masks and protective items are also with the states and the central government .
Yet within three weeks a strict national lockdown was imposed.
The central government backed its action on March 24 by pointing out that " more than thirty states and union territories had imposed a complete embargo " even before the prime minister's announcement .
A night in Kolkata during a lockdown
The central government did not say whether most of the states had announced the lockdown considering their local conditions and readiness.
Globally ...
When India imposed the lockdown, some European nations had already imposed sanctions, while in many places there were lockdowns.
These included Italy (according to the World Health Organization, Italy had 60,000 patients at the time, with about 6,000 deaths), Spain (about 50,000 patients and 3,000 deaths) and France (about 20,000 patients and about 700 deaths). .
But with more than 80,000 patients and 3,000 deaths, China imposed a lockdown in Hubei province alone.
How did the Indian government take this decision?
Prime Minister Modi's speech on March 24 was part of a public outcry over the lockdown announcement.
Lockout order
It is important to note that the Prime Minister is the chairman of this authority.
The order issued by the National Disaster Management Authority's 'Policy and Planning Department' to the Union Home Ministry on March 24, 2020, said, "Continuity is needed in the implementation of various measures across the country.
The Union Home Secretary, who chairs the National Executive Committee of the Disaster Management Authority, issued the guidelines on March 24.
We also contacted the National Disaster Management Authority.
We applied to the authority under the Right to Information Act.
We also inquired about the number of meetings of the National Disaster Management Authority on Corona Partnership held before 24 March 2020 in the presence of the Prime Minister.
Responding to our application, the authority said that no such consultation process had taken place, and no meeting on the issue had been held in the presence of the Prime Minister.
Disaster management response
What did the Prime Minister's Office say?
Attempts have been made to paint a picture of the Prime Minister personally taking the lead in national measures since the outbreak of the corona virus.
So we asked the Prime Minister's Office for a list of how many meetings related to the corona virus were held in the presence of the Prime Minister.
We also asked for a list of which ministers, chief ministers and advisers were consulted before the announcement of the national lockdown.
Answer from the Prime Minister's Office
The Prime Minister's Office did not provide the information, despite repeated inquiries.
While rejecting an application, it was described as 'rough' and 'suspicious'.
While refusing to respond to the second application, the Prime Minister's Office relied on Section 7 (9) of the Right to Information Act.
According to Anjali Bharadwaj, who works for transparency and accountability in governance, the provision will not exempt the government from the rules.
The Prime Minister had interacted with the Chief Minister on March 20, 2020, four days before the announcement of the lockdown.
In this context , the word 'lockout' is not mentioned anywhere in the press release issued by the Prime Minister's Office .
So we asked for information on whether the issue of national lockout was discussed.
The application was forwarded by the Prime Minister's Office to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and then to the Ministry of Home Affairs.
Leaflet sent by the Prime Minister's Office
Now let's talk about the Ministry of Home Affairs
The role of the Home Ministry in these developments is particularly important for two reasons.
One, the guidelines on lockdown were published under the authority of the Ministry of Home Affairs.
Two, the important departments and ministries with which we contacted regarding the lockdown decisions and many of them transferred our applications to the Ministry of Home Affairs.
Home Ministry response
Our request for information on what consultations the Home Ministry held before the lockdown was announced was rejected.
Because what
According to the Ministry, the issues in our application are "of strategic and economic interest and some of the information contained in the trust is disconnected from disclosure under Section 8 (1) (a) and (u) of the Right to Information Act, 2005. Has arrived. "
Home Ministry response
Similar responses were received in many RTI applications.
Home Ministry response
Did the states know this?
Before the central government imposed the lockdown, the offices of the lieutenant governor, chief minister and chief secretary in the capital Delhi had no information about the consultation.
Similarly, the Chief Ministers' Offices in Assam and Telangana said that they did not have any information suggesting that consultations were held before the announcement.
The secretariats of the governors of Punjab, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh said that they did not have any such information.
Response from Uttar Pradesh Governor's Secretariat
In particular, the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister's Office sent back our question and asked the Government of India to inquire into the matter.
The Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region at the Center was working with the states in the region to address the issue.
North Eastern Ministry of Development
What happened to the Corona virus group of ministers and when was the lockdown discussed in the cabinet ?
The government announced on February 3, 2020 that a high-level group of ministers had been set up by the Prime Minister to review how the corona virus is treated.
The group of ministers is headed by Health Minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan had and the ministers of civil aviation, foreign affairs, shipping, home, etc. were in this group.
The group held several meetings between February 3 and the implementation of the lockout.
We contacted the Cabinet Secretariat to find out if the group of ministers had recommended a lockdown, or if there had been any discussion with the group.
Why did we ask this to the Cabinet Secretariat?
This is because "the Secretariat provides secretarial assistance to the Cabinet and Cabinet Committees, as well as assists the Government in the decision-making process by proposing inter-ministerial coordination .
However, the Secretariat also sent our application to the Home Ministry.
A few days later, the Cabinet responded by saying, "The information you have sought is excluded from disclosure under sections 8 (1), (a) and (u) of the Right to Information Act, 2005."
The same information application was also sent to the Ministry of Health.
According to information received from the Cabinet Secretariat, the Union Cabinet meeting was held in the days before the lockout.
Answer of Central Secretariat
' We knew the lockdown was coming'
Although the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting did not respond, we asked the Deputy Chairman of the Policy Commission, Dr. Rajiv Kumar was asked about the lockdown.
'Anti-democratic attitude'
Reviewing the response to our information requests from the National Disaster Management Authority and the Union Ministry of Home Affairs, Anjali said, "Disaster management rights are wide-ranging.
Commenting on the manner in which the RTI application was rejected, Anjali said, "These responses are not acceptable.
Anjali said that the states had not given them prior notice of the lockdown, adding that "this does not lead to accountability.
Corona vaccine: Can manufacturers meet the global demand for vaccines?
The scene when the AstraZeneca vaccine produced in India reached Bangladesh.
India, one of the world's largest producers of corona virus vaccines, is finding it difficult to meet global demand for the vaccine.
Orders for doses to be sent to the UK are likely to take some time to complete, and large orders for Nepal have also been put on hold, according to the largest vaccine manufacturer.
Is there a shortage of doses?
The Serum Institute of India in Pune, India produces Novavax and AstraZeneca vaccines.
Adar Poonawala, CEO of the Serum Institute, said the shortage was due to the US export ban on certain vaccine-making bags and filters.
The company also said it was having difficulty importing disposable tubes, cell culture media and certain chemicals.
It takes certain ingredients to make a vaccine.
The distribution of these raw materials is going to be a big issue.
The Serum Institute has written a letter to the Government of India urging it to intervene and resolve the issue so as to ensure smooth production and supply of vaccines worldwide.
There is another Indian pharmaceutical company - Biological E. The company produces Johnson & Johnson vaccines.
In the past, American suppliers have been reluctant to guarantee that their delivery date will be met, says Mahima Dat, the company's chief executive.
Why did the US take a stand?
US President Joe Biden has suggested that the administration should consider whether there could be a future shortage of ingredients for vaccine production.
Biden enacted the Defense Production Act (DPA).
Accordingly, the President may impose restrictions on the export of goods required for domestic production.
The Biden administration said the law would be used to prioritize the supply of special pumps and filtration units to vaccine manufacturers in the United States.
This was followed by objections from vaccine manufacturers around the world in early March.
Vaccine manufacturers have said that export restrictions on supplies from some major suppliers will affect vaccine production worldwide.
Some of the items that need to be of standard quality can take up to 12 months to get from others, the manufacturers said.
Dr. Sarah Schiffling is an expert on the Vaccine Supply Chain at John Moore University in Liverpool.
She says the supply chain in the pharmaceutical sector is complex.
The sudden shortage of demand from around the world is inevitable, she added.
Effects on vaccine production in India
There are currently 2 vaccines allowed in India.
Since January, 130 million doses of Kovishield manufactured by the Serum Institute have been used or exported in the country.
Vaccine storage center in Bangalore
Indian vaccine companies have increased production by setting up new manufacturing plants to meet domestic and global demand or by converting separate manufacturing units into covid vaccine manufacturing units for a few months.
The Serum Institute had said in January that we can now produce 6 to 7 crore doses of vaccine per month.
The Serum Institute had earlier told the BBC that its goal was to increase production to 100 million doses per month by March.
Is the demand in India being met?
The vaccination campaign in India was launched on January 16.
In some parts of the country, the number of Kovid patients has increased.
So far, the Serum Institute has agreed to provide 100 million doses to the Government of India.
India has also signed an agreement with Russia's Gamaleya Research Institute to produce 200 million doses of their Sputnik vaccine.
Indian manufacturers will also manufacture the vaccine for the Indian market and for export.
In January, Adar Poonawala, head of the Siram Institute, had suggested that the vaccine was allowed on the condition that the Siram Institute would prioritize India's domestic needs.
However, the Indian government later clarified that there were no restrictions on lashi exports after Bangladesh inquired whether the agreement reached with it for Kovishield would be fulfilled.
Who will get the vaccine in India?
The Serum Institute of India supports the Covax group of the United Nations.
Serum had agreed in September 2020 to give Kovax 200 million doses of AstraZeneca or Novavax vaccine.
Corona test
In addition, Serum has signed a bilateral trade agreement to supply 90 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine and 14.5 million doses of Novavax, according to United Nations figures.
The Government of India has also donated vaccines to many countries, especially to South Asian trading countries.
So far, the Indian government has donated more vaccines worldwide than China.
Ramdev Baba's 'Coronil' not recognized as Covid-19 drug - Assistant Drugs Controller
Assistant Drug Controller Sushant Sarkar clarified that Ramdev Baba's 'Coronil' was not approved as a treatment against Covid-19.
The information was given in response to a petition filed by an information officer filed by the Indian Medical Association.
Dr. of the Indian Medical Association.
Letter from the Assistant Drugs Controller
Coronil made by Ramdev Baba's Ayurvedic manufacturer Patanjali has been banned in Maharashtra.
What's so significant about a coronal?
Patanjali had claimed that the drug coronil was effective against the corona virus.
Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh had tweeted about this.
In his tweet, Anil Deshmukh said, "The IMA has questioned the alleged medical tests of Coronil.
Home Minister Deshmukh had said that uncertified coronil from WHO, IMA and other organizations could not be sold in Maharashtra.
The controversy erupted after Patanjali claimed that coronil was effective against covid-19 and that it was approved by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The World Health Organization (WHO) immediately rejected the claims of Baba Ramdev and Patanjali.
The controversy was sparked by the presence of Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan at the Coronil launch.
On the other hand, the presence of the Union Health Minister at the launch of 'Coronil' angered private doctors across the country.
WHO rejects claim
Patanjali's claim was later rejected by the WHO.
The World Health Organization has not tested or approved any conventional anti-corona drug.
Acharya Balakrishna, Executive Director, Patanjali Ayurveda Ltd., later tweeted that the 'Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product' given to Coronil was not issued by WHO but by DCGI.
Corona virus: 25,833 new corona patients a day in Maharashtra, why are the numbers increasing despite vaccination?
The state on Thursday (March 18) found 25,833 new patients infected with corona.
On Thursday, the state surpassed the highest number of daily corona patients ever.
As a result, the number of patients infected with corona virus in Maharashtra so far has reached 23 lakh 29 thousand 464.
The second wave of corona has started in Maharashtra.
The total number of new patients in India in the 24 hours from March 17 to 18 was 35,871.
The ongoing vaccination campaign for Covid 19 in India is the largest vaccination campaign in the world.
So why is the number of Kovid-19 patients increasing in Maharashtra even though vaccination is on?
Is there adequate supply of vaccine in the state?
Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope wrote a letter to the Center on March 16 demanding more doses for the state.
The Union Health Minister has demanded that 2 crore 20 lakh doses be made available for vaccination of about 1 crore 77 lakh people in the priority group.
Maharashtra has demanded immediate supply of adequate vaccines to control the growing number of corona cases in the state, but Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar has claimed that Maharashtra has adequate stocks of the vaccine.
He tweeted about the role of the central government.
"The central government had given 54 lakh vaccines to Maharashtra till March 12.
So there is another issue with the supply of vaccines.
On March 16, all the state chief ministers held a meeting with Prime Minister Modi via video conferencing.
Why is the number of patients increasing despite vaccination?
At the dawn of 2021, there were 5,000 to 7,000 cases in the country.
But where did your vaccination campaign come from when Corona was trying to get her head back on its head?
Vaccination statistics
As many as 35 lakh 73 thousand 489 vaccines have been administered in the state till March 14 and two doses of 7 per cent people have been completed.
Number of patients
Speaking to BBC Marathi about the increase in the number of patients, Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope said, "It is a surprise to us that there is no real reason for such an increase.
On the other hand, the member of the policy commission, Dr. VK Paul has expressed concern over the situation in Maharashtra at a weekly press conference held last week.
Corona vaccination: Misconceptions about vaccines, which are true, which are false?
The second phase of the vaccination campaign for Covid 19 is underway in India.
After vaccinating health workers and frontline workers in the first phase, now in the second phase, citizens above 50 years of age and those under the age of 50 with sympathizers are vaccinated.
But people have some doubts about this vaccine.
For example, the corona vaccine causes impotence in a man or a woman, or the face becomes paralyzed with gas.
Corona vaccination and misconceptions
Corona vaccination campaigns have been launched in many countries around the world.
Corona drug
For the first phase of vaccination, the central government has procured 10 million doses of covshield vaccine and 55 lakh doses of covacin.
Does the corona vaccine cause impotence?
There is a widespread belief that the corona vaccine causes impotence in both men and women, not only in India but all over the world.
There is no scientific evidence that the Covid 19 vaccine causes impotence in either men or women.
No such cases have been reported in worldwide trials of the Covishield vaccine.
Does corona vaccine cause covid 19?
Another question was constantly asked to Harshvardhan during Facebook Live.
Replying to this, the Health Minister said, "You will not get Covid 19 when you are vaccinated with Covid.
Both Covishield and Covacin vaccines were developed by extracting spike proteins from the dead corona virus.
Will these vaccines protect against the new corona?
As the year 2020 drew to a close, an outbreak of the altered corona virus began in the UK and South Africa.
No research has shown that existing vaccines cannot protect against the new corona virus found in the UK and South Africa.
Will only senior citizens and children be vaccinated?
In the first phase, 30 crore people including senior citizens and health workers were vaccinated.
On this Dr. Harshvardhan says, "In setting the priorities, the government has decided to vaccinate health workers, emergency services, cleaners, people over 50 years of age and those with a serious illness first.
Care to be taken at the time of vaccination
In addition, the Ministry of Health has issued a statement on what to look out for when vaccinating, who should be vaccinated and who should not.
Only people over the age of 18 will be vaccinated.
Two vaccines have been approved by the central government.
If a person has a reaction to the vaccine after taking the first dose, that is, if they have some adverse effects of the vaccine, such a person should not be given a second dose.
Such a woman should not be vaccinated if she is pregnant or breastfeeding.
Those who currently have covid-19 and are undergoing treatment should not be vaccinated.
There is a lot of information on corona vaccination.

'Fear of nationwide outbreak'
The fight against the Corona is now coming to an end.
Speaking to the Chief Minister, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, "More than 96 per cent patients have been cured in India.
He further said, "It can be seen that the test positivity rate is very high in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh and the number is also increasing.
The Prime Minister said that in many places the local administration was not taking the issue of masks and physical distance very seriously.
He said, "This is a test of good governance.
'Need to focus on small towns'
The Prime Minister said, "One thing we need to pay close attention to is that this time our Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities, which were not initially affected, have a growing number of cases in their vicinity.
Danger of the Corona variant
Some new types of corona have been found in some countries.
It is necessary to find out whether the corona virus has made any changes in India itself.
This will let you know if there is a new variant of the corona virus in your state, he said.
'Vaccine waste should be stopped immediately'
Today we have the vaccine on corona.
He said, "After a year of fighting against corona, we have a vaccine in our hands.
Telangana and Andhra Pradesh are wasting more than 10 per cent of the dose.
He said that if there are any problems in planning and governance at the local level, vaccines should be eliminated immediately.
Prime Minister Modi says, I think states should work towards the goal of 'Zero Vaccine Waste'.
Prime Minister's instructions
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that his administration has received good training over the last year on how to work while fighting the corona virus, adding that the administration now needs to be proactive.

The Prime Minister also thanked the Corona Warriors, the state governments, the administration and the people for their contribution to India's success in the fight against the Corona.
Do not stop Covid 19 vaccination, WHO appeals to European countries
Some European countries have banned the use of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine.
France, Italy and Germany have banned the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine due to an increase in blood clotting.
However, the World Health Organization says there is no evidence that vaccines are the cause of blood clots.
Many small European countries, including Germany, France, Italy and Spain, have stopped vaccinations as a precaution and are being investigated.
The World Health Organization's security experts are meeting on Tuesday.
Vaccines are being reviewed around the world, but the World Health Organization says it is important that vaccinations continue.
WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeyer said: "The WHO is fully aware of this, has done a thorough study and if there is a need to make any changes to the current instructions, it will be communicated immediately.
A total of 17 million people in the European Union and the UK have been vaccinated.

Boat quarantine has started here for tourists!
Tourists visiting Thailand can now be quarantined on a yacht.
Tourists visiting Thailand can now spend their two weeks on a mandatory quarantine boat.
The Thai government has launched this new initiative.
The country's tourism business has been hit hard by the Corona virus.
Earlier in January, the government had allowed tourists to spend their segregation on a golf course.
This South Asian country is heavily dependent on tourism for income.
The 'Quarantine on the Boat' initiative was announced on Monday, March 8.
During the Corona virus, the number of tourists visiting the area dropped from 40,000-50,000 to hundreds.
Color training
Boat applications are being accepted for participation.
The yacht quarantine scheme has been announced by the Thai government's Digital Economy Promotion Agency.
The yacht quarantine scheme has been announced by the Thai government's Digital Economy Promotion Agency.
Tourists participating will have to wear a small wristband.
The device can also transmit information from the sea in a 10-kilometer strip, the Thai government said.
Thailand banned tourists from entering the country in March last year.
Last month, Thailand's tourism minister announced plans to provide tourists with a quarantine option as well as popular beach resorts.
Quarantine at resorts or hotels is expected to begin in April or May in popular locations such as Phuket, Krabi and Chiang Mai.
Corona Vaccine: In some countries, will the corona never be vaccinated?
Global vaccination
Vaccination for Covid 19 has started in many countries of the world.
Because giving the vaccine for Covid 19 to the whole world is a matter of life and death.
Only a handful of countries have specific targets for vaccination, but the picture is not so clear elsewhere in the world.
This process of vaccination is complicated.
When will I get the vaccine?
The first phase of vaccination started from January 16 in India.
In addition to government vaccination centers, some private hospitals are also allowed to vaccinate.
Serum Institute's Covishield vaccine and Bharat Biotech - ICMR's Covacin vaccine are currently being administered in India.
Take a look at how the vaccination campaign for Covid 19 is underway around the world.
Corona virus
How many vaccines have been given so far?
More than 30 million doses of the various vaccines for Covid 19 have been administered in over 100 countries worldwide.
It is true that vaccinations began less than a year after the coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China, but there are disparities in vaccination campaigns around the world.
Some countries have acquired vaccine doses for the majority of their population and are beginning to reach them.
Most countries give priority to these citizens in the first phase of their vaccination:
Over 60 years of age
Health worker
People at high risk of covid
The effects of the vaccine are beginning to show in countries like Israel and the UK.
Although vaccination campaigns have been launched in almost all of Europe and the United States, only a handful of countries in Africa have been vaccinated.
Agathe Demrais, director of the Global Forecasting Unit at The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), has done extensive research.
The total production capacity of the vaccine in the world, the health system required to reach the vaccine population, the total population of that country and how much vaccine this country can afford were studied.
The findings of this research are somewhat expected in terms of the difference between rich and poor.
Canada and some of the richest countries in Europe follow.
Vaccination has not yet begun in most low-income countries. But there are some exceptions to this.
Corona virus
Global vaccination campaign
Have rich countries stockpiled vaccines?
At the end of 2020, Canada was criticized for buying five times more vaccines than our country's population needed.
When Donald Trump was president, Canada invested in vaccines from European vaccine companies, thinking that the US might ban vaccine exports.
Companies in Europe have not been able to keep the supply of vaccines in check, and in recent times only European countries have threatened to ban exports.
But there are also some countries that are performing better than expected.
Corona glue
At the time of writing, Serbia was the eighth most vaccinated country in the world in terms of population.
The effective implementation of the vaccination campaign is a testament to Serbia's success, but also its strategic agreement on vaccines.
Although Serbian citizens are given the option to choose the Pfizer, Sputnik or Cyanoform vaccine, in reality the majority are given the Cyanoform vaccine.
What is vaccine diplomacy?
China's influence in the region is likely to be long-lasting.
The UAE also relies heavily on Chinese vaccines.
The vaccine factories, the trained staff are all being supplied by China.
But the large supply of vaccines to the world does not mean that the population of one's own country will be the first to receive the vaccine.
China and India, two of the world's largest suppliers of vaccines, are expected to be under-vaccinated by the end of 2022, according to EIU research.
What are the challenges?
India's success as the world's largest producer of covid vaccine is, in fact, due to this one man.
But even before the vaccine's effectiveness was proven, his family had begun to question Adar Poonawala's decision to invest millions of dollars in it.
The vaccine, developed by Oxford and AstraZeneca, was adopted by the Indian government in January, and the Serum Institute now produces 2.4 million doses of the vaccine daily.
Adar tells Poonawala, "I thought that once the product was ready, the stress would go away.
He says production cannot be increased overnight.
These things take time. People think the Serum Institute has a magic wand.
