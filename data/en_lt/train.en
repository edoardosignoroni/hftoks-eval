Finally, I would like to point out that the label now also benefits goods produced to last a long time and goods that can be re-used.
The principle of subsidiarity, multi-level governance, strategic planning and simplified implementation of the regional policy must be linked effectively in order to achieve an ideal balance between quality, performance and financial control.
It has offered us a mirror - which, I think, was very much needed - for asking important questions, such as how ready we are to complement the aspirations of emerging democracies, how far we are ready to go to deal with the situations like the one we face in Libya, and how long we should make compromises here and there and associate stability with autocracy, accepting that we have not always had the values in the same place as our interests.
In this regard, there are five points that I would like to make concerning areas where we may be able to make further improvements.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, a large potential for new exporting opportunities lies in the Asian markets that have high growth rates but also, of course, high barriers to entry.
I wish you all success for the ratification process.
I would also remind them that, while people in countries outside the market economy, under the shelter of the Berlin Wall, met their well-documented fate, globalisation and the market economy enabled Western Europeans to prosper at an average rate of 2% growth per annum.
However, it seems that no deal is currently in place that would allow free downloads of their music catalogues.

Oral explanations of vote
Lastly, we must encourage insurance companies to intervene as quickly as possible and subsequently learn lessons from such events when it comes to issuing planning permission.
However, that support should be given to genuine democratic forces and we should never intentionally assist an organisation such as the Muslim Brotherhood in establishing a theocratic dictatorship in Egypt by giving it the EU's support.
Let us not forget that it is not only important that functional items be appropriately designed and that safe materials be used for their manufacture; it is equally important that common sense be applied while using them, and that children who have access to them be properly supervised.
A recent Eurobarometer poll indicated that whilst 72% of EU citizens say the European Union is 'playing a positive role in creating new job opportunities and fighting unemployment,' only a little over a third of respondents had heard of the EU's tools to combat unemployment, such as the European Social Fund and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.
What opportunity did we actually have to present that?
The rapporteur is, however, aware that the Greens have retabled their own amendments seeking to update the line between Munich city and Munich airport, but the rapporteur would like to reiterate the point that the changes we are making in this report are about correcting the text, not updating it.
European institutions are failing spectacularly to understand the nature of the problem.
Once ENISA has been modernised, the latest information will be gathered from European countries, there will be encouragement to share best practices and the European Union and the Member States will be better prepared to prevent, detect and respond more effectively to network and information security problems.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner Vassiliou, Minister Bachelot-Narquin, last week I attended a presentation of a new website on patient rights in all the EU languages, organised by my Danish colleague in the ALDE Group, Karen Riis-Jørgensen.

The elections in Poland in 1989 are an example.
Integration in the Baltic region is patchy.
The man who claims to have saved the world is about to come here in a couple of hours' time but, leaving that aside, it is to the national governments - in Paris or London or Washington or Rome - that the citizens of those countries (who also happen to be told that they are citizens of Europe) look to save them, not this larger entity called the EU.
The report shows that, overall, e-commerce is developing rather well in the European Union, while cross-border e-commerce lags behind.

The first example I would like to give is that, according to Eurostat, 90% of EU citizens are in favour of families consisting of a wife, a husband and their children.
(LT) Madam President, probably everyone would agree that information is one of the main driving forces in the modern world.
The Members who want to ask questions are not the ones who are responsible for the fact that we are running so late.
Secondly, we are always hearing, and we have heard in this debate too, that we, the European Parliament, have to stick our necks out at first reading and take particularly demanding positions, as the Council will subsequently put the brakes on anyway, and in the end we shall not get where we want to go.
Thirdly, solidarity must of course also apply to the developing countries.
Similar lapses today could lead to the banning of political parties and trade unions, which will be a real blow to democracy, the rule of law and civil liberties.
What this means is that we need to work within the framework of international private law and not within the substantive framework of family law, wherein each State will continue to have its own laws.
This is the truth of the matter; this is how things are.
in writing. - (DE) We expressly support Croatia's swift accession to the European Union.
As a representative of this House, let me say that we wish the AAL programme the greatest success.

Yes, I am defending Germany.

The response cannot and should not be on a case by case basis.
Madam President, fellow Members, Members of the Commission, we all know that economic globalisation, the international financial crisis and all future challenges must be addressed at the global level.
We are now in a global economic condition with the global recession where there are the beginnings of the whiff of protectionism coming from the developed world, especially from the United States, and I hope not from the European Union.
What is it that makes you so nervous?
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission welcomes the report presented and the support given to our perspectives regarding the ecosystem approach.
The measures proposed by Mrs Batzeli in her report are aimed at reducing the pressures exerted by supermarkets and promoting a direct relationship between consumers and producers.
On the one hand, the lack of rules opens the door to many cases of inhumane practices involving immigrants.
We would point out that this involves expanding the features of the SIS by developing them, extending access to new authorities and interlinking them, with the addition of new categories of data (such as the data capture mandate and biometric data).
We have to remember, however, that today we have also just had a very serious discussion about the crisis in Europe's car industry, and this week we will also be dealing with problems in the textile industry and European Globalisation Adjustment Fund aid as compensation for the massive layoffs in that sector in Spain and Portugal.
So to apply the instruments which we have in the most effective manner possible will need a strategic approach, of course - mainstream, as some of you have said.
One thing is clear, however: this Europe will only be a good Europe if it is a democratic one.
This is why it is important for the legislative package envisaged by the Commission to include targets relating to the elimination of these gender pay gaps, in order to encourage greater participation by women in the labour market.
There is a chemical called Roundup which can actually be sprayed on the banks of a river or a stream.
The purpose is identical: to raise the standard of living and improve the quality of life, ensure a high level of employment, improve social cohesion and combat exclusion.
However, this indicator is not holistic.
(DA) Madam President, we are here again today with something that has been pushed through by people who have not been elected, namely, the European Court of Justice, which, by means of a series of rulings, has put pressure on the genuinely elected institutions to also draw up this directive that has been voted through today.
For instance, the European Union has recently expressed its concerns regarding secret detention, and we hope that the President-elect will then address this issue and Member States will be able to answer.

Effects of the economic crisis on world trade (debate)
Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank Mrs García Pérez, Mrs Jöns and Mr Angelaka, who have submitted excellent reports, and all the Members who have spoken.
Much less is the deregulation strategy, which the Commission is pursuing in multilateral and increasingly also in bilateral negotiations, the right way to boost global sustainable development, because this mainly targets worldwide access for European enterprises operating transnationally and concentrates far too little on small and medium-sized enterprises.
According to 'Save the Children', the Indian non-governmental organisation, an estimated 60 million children still work today in fields, restaurants or factories in India.
Let me also assure you that I will share your conclusions with my colleagues in the Commission.

It is reflective of a deeper malaise for the people and Europe.
The cases of the South African Development Community (SADC) and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) are typical.
But, given that, as it now stands, companies can opt in or opt out, we would end up with 28 tax bases instead of the current 27, and that is hardly simplification.
My concern in relation to this issue is that the fear we had in the 1980s has been forgotten and, as a result, we are taking our eye off the situation, when there is a whole generation of people who did not grow up in the 1980s who need to hear the message again.
But sadly, CETA does come up with some other demands and political goals which we find deeply worrying.
We should endeavour to ensure that the programmes which are offered give the greatest possible support to the reforms being undertaken in these countries to bring them closer to the Union.
(DE) Mr President, we have numerous Erasmus programmes for students, young entrepreneurs and now for journalists.
Firstly, it is not a matter of lowering our sights merely to the creation of a transatlantic free trade area, but of making sure the development of our trade serves other more laudable objectives, which promote social and environmental standards.
Everyone essentially agrees to the principle of paying the true costs. Yet, when it comes to the specific measures to implement true costs, we hear a thousand excuses.
My group and I are, of course, happy with the compromise that has been negotiated by Dr Klinz and others.
Moreover, it is essential that the Commission makes its supervision of structural spending more effective, setting up suspension and adjustment procedures and developing a new Member State reporting system, bearing in mind that there are problems with 40% of the Commission audits.
I would like to ask the Commissioners what their response to this is.
Do not listen too much to the Member States; listen instead to the Spanish Presidency, because it has some good ideas on this subject.
We also said that we were in favour of a very close relationship between the central banks and the supervisory authorities.
The new President of Ukraine, on his first foreign visit since taking office, is coming to Brussels.
It appears that the European Solidarity Fund may be too restrictive to deal with this situation.
We need to consider how we can work together instead of imposing some form of harmonisation on the Member States from above.
I agree with him when he says that the fund as such cannot solve all of the problems straight away.
At the same time, we are also keen for the EU to pursue a responsible budgetary policy and therefore welcome the passages stating that we will also continue to identify and evaluate negative priorities.
Such management systems come under the jurisdiction of the Member States, and rightly so: they concern the history, society, economy, geography and hydrology of each country.
We must continue to work towards this goal by amending FP7.
For instance, there has been an exodus from some European Union countries of qualified, well-trained workers, in which Member States had made a significant investment.
(DE) Mr President, the climate conference in Cancún must exert positive pressure on our states in order to make progress in terms of international cooperation and national climate protection legislation.

Thus, we would contribute to the security of passengers who use airlines' services.
Therefore, this should be used as an opportunity for a radical overhaul of document access and publication procedures.
Is it a matter of learning to live with this state of affairs?
Lastly, we are delighted that the Committee on Budgets has endorsed the EURES first job initiative, since this is a real contribution by the European Parliament to the Youth on the Move flagship initiative, and it is also a tool to aid social innovation, which we need to develop.
Through his own drive and initiative he will certainly be able to launch or speed up many challenging projects.
We can only welcome the call made in the initiative for a code of procedure.
Yet again we have cause for concern about ethnic diversity in the Vojvodina region of Northern Serbia, since in many decisions the European Parliament has declared this to be a value to be protected.
This is another subject on which we await your proposals, Commissioner.
Madam President, I am pleased that you are in the chair for a second time for a debate on maritime policy.
However, we must, of course, ensure that it does not fall on deaf ears.
With its strong middle class, high level of education, closeness to Europe and overall moderation, Tunisia is well placed to take the leap towards democracy that people have now asked for with such force and courage, and I think everyone should agree that the European Union also has a strong interest in a democratic, prosperous and stable Tunisia.
Paramount in all of this, however, are the needs and safety of the children, many of whom are in great need.
I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Chastel, and the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, for their introduction to the discussion.
The other equally important matter was to find a balance between the main players operating in this sector, i.e. the interests of airports and airlines.
Are we to believe that this decision has nothing to do with the free trade agreement that has just been negotiated?
It is therefore necessary to adopt appropriate strategies as a precaution against such risks.
Madam President, I should like to say this to the Vice-President/High Representative: I appreciate very much what you said in your first speech on your policy and what you have been doing with North Africa - Egypt, Tunisia, Libya - and especially the focus you put on the young people and women there, and your approach to deep democracy that has to be rooted.
Interpretation of the Rules of Procedure : see Minutes
Mr Solana, we have heard very clearly that you are awaiting replies to the questions you put to Mr Jalili; Commissioner Ferrero has informed us of this, and we too are still waiting for replies to the questions we put to him.

(DE) Mr President, I wanted to direct a further question to Mr Verheugen.
The Treaty of Lisbon declares that we must have adequate social protection, that we must encourage people to stay in work, that we must eliminate poverty traps, etc., etc., etc., and yet we reduce the minimum wage by EUR 2 000 a year.
All countries must be treated equally.
Thank you, Commissioner, for your update.
As you know, the restructuring fund did not fulfil our expectations during the second year of the restructuring period, after actually quite a promising first year.
Mr President, it is now July, the month in which, even in spite of the crisis, many Europeans decide to spend their holidays on a cruise, or to travel by ship.
(PT) Mr President, the noticeably lower expectations that we saw before the Cancún conference should not justify excessively optimistic discussions with regard to its results, and it should be regarded as a success even less so.
I also consider it an urgent matter, of course, to improve the safety of humanitarian workers.
So we need to look at how we identify that form of trafficking.
The current agreement with Mauritania has been contributing to the economic development of Mauritania, where the fisheries sector is one of the fundamental pillars of the economy, representing almost 10% of gross domestic product (GDP), 29% of national budget revenue and almost 50% of exports.
(Applause)

We therefore support this report.
The death penalty is a cruel and inhuman punishment.
The regulation establishes a common framework in relation to market surveillance.
This is severely affecting the poor, as well as producers of meat and milk.
Now let go of the reins on these joint technology initiatives (JTIs), where industry plays a 50% role, yet we carry on as if they were public sector organisations!
It represents lower costs for industry and, above all, for SMEs, which is essential.
Is it not the case that they are also allowed to say 'no'?
Madagascar is a country with which we work closely and intensively.
We are indeed aware of the problem to which you have been so kind as to draw my attention.
The problem is that this food security is a one-off measure, so we are helping at the time of crisis.
There are many problems with the current legal framework and the situation within Europe when it comes to patients' access to information about prescription-only medicines.
We know full well, however, that there are contradictions in this area too.
After the discussion in our group, and following your response, I will then present this decision in the second round.
However, the system cannot fail to be analysed across all of the many dimensions in which it may be applied.
The Commission and the Council must strongly and openly support civil society in Venezuela and must watch with great care the upcoming parliamentary elections.
Between 1997 and 2000, Commissioner, Romania 'exported' 9 150 children.
We are aware of imaging processes, for example, that will also play a major role in this regard in future.
In accordance with that declaration, the Union should express clear support for the movement in Korea which is working for the abolition of capital punishment.
Therefore, I would request that we vote on Amendment 80 as an addition to 37, if Members like it - which is a different matter - as it looks like we are also doing with Amendment 81.
I would like to explain my vote on the draft Council Regulation repealing a number of obsolete Council Acts relating to the Common Agricultural Policy.
I am glad that the European Parliament and Mr Özdemir have taken up precisely that question with this sound report.
I hope that one of the minor side-effects of this will be transparency.
These measures are already in place in some Member States.
I know you are new to the job, but do you believe that their standards, should they ever reach them, are equivalent to ours, given that they only require 90 days and 40 days?
A lot remains to be done, and it was very moving to see so many defenders of human rights here this morning.
The Commission is of the opinion that the compromise package tabled by your rapporteur, Mr Rapkay, is a very good result that can be fully supported.
Trade relations between the EU and India are significant, since the EU is India's principal trade partner and its biggest foreign investor.
Only for EU Member State Slovenia and candidate country Croatia has that not changed.
I think history will not forgive us for failing to act a second time.
There is a strong need to consolidate the experience of 'A to G' and involve industry, not by force, but by really involving them.
We do not want to conduct a debate here now.
This report will be useful only if it helps to increase the frequency, comparability and accuracy of these data at EU level.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FI) Mr President, tomorrow we shall adopt the EU's budget for next year, one in which payments clearly fall below the 1% ceiling, to say nothing of the fact that it will be 1.24% of GNI.
I have two points to make, first of all on the trajectory in terms of reductions, flexibility and penalties, which was particularly discussed during the trialogue at the weekend.
There is a real danger that pregnant workers or women who recently gave birth, who are in a more vulnerable position, will suffer discrimination in the current circumstances.
That is not the problem.

There should be only one seat for Europe in Mexico rather than the eight that were apparently needed in Copenhagen.
Now, with the current majorities in Congress, the law is not even on the table - with the result that we must assume that things will be more difficult unless we succeed in taking some of these matters further with countries such as China, India or Brazil.
The fight against terrorism (vote)
When drawing up my report, I had four objectives:
I therefore welcome the Youth on the Move initiative, in particular, its aspect of supporting and encouraging student mobility, and of recognising qualifications, as well as the importance ascribed to non-formal and informal education, which are often as important as formal learning or even more so.

For the first time since 2000, the percentage spent on official aid has fallen, from 0.41% in 2006 to 0.38% in 2007.
I will be more than happy to report back to you after our next meeting on what we are planning.

A massacre is also happening in Iran, but it happens in slow motion.
We are waiting until we have a European prosecutor and then OLAF will no longer be what it is today.
Attention should be drawn to the fact that Eurostat will be granted the main supervisory and liability functions in these areas.
We do not need more planned economy in the European Union; others have failed on that front before.

After all, it is possible to learn from the mistakes of the past, rather than repeating them.
I congratulate you on the balanced findings of the draft resolution.
Indeed, how can we advocate respect for the common interest, on the one hand, and call for shared public-private governance that does not hinder free competition, on the other?
For this - and I urge the President-in-Office, the Commissioner and Madam President to remember this - we need a tripartite declaration from all three institutions.
There are parts of the report of which we do not approve, for example the question of safe and secure parking areas for professional drivers, which we regard as a matter for the Member States.
I think that during all these years, the most important and most interesting thing he did was to have constantly persisted in saying the truth.
Forwarding of texts adopted during the sitting: see Minutes
In our opinion, however, the proposal for a regulation presented by the European Commission did not seem to us to offer due protection of confidentiality or to respect the various aspects entailed in the whole complex process of collecting such data.
We, on the other hand, thought that in the light of climate change it was necessary and that the Marine Strategy Directive should not therefore be laden with details which would render it impossible.
Protection of privacy must also apply to e-mail and other electronic correspondence and the basic principles of all our legislation, proportionality, necessity and non-discrimination, are emphasised.
A weak point of the Directive is the financing of measures to adjust to the objectives undertaken by the Member States until 2010, or 2015 respectively.
The Armenian lobby is so vociferous in this Parliament precisely because of the apparent conspiracy of silence that has surrounded the genocide question for almost a century.
The EU took an active approach in mobilising more resources from the international community to enable outstanding work at the Chernobyl site to be completed and we are continuing our efforts in this direction with our own contribution.
As regards the proposal for a single register, I do not think that there is any need for such a register with the Commission since the European Parliament and the Commission operate in completely different ways and, consequently, have different relationships with lobbyists.
There is a need to simplify the acquis communautaire by repealing those directives which contain provisions on means of measurement that are no longer used as a result of technical progress and the use of international standards.
The solutions introduced will help to improve the situation of patients in the European Union and will strengthen the common market, and so I voted in favour of adoption of the directive.

Mr President, I refer back to point 16 in the resolution where we say that 'Afghanistan's security problems are more complex than just a war on terror and that they therefore require more than a military solution'.
For the first time, with the introduction of Article 3a, the spouses are given an opportunity to designate the law applicable to the divorce proceedings by mutual agreement.
It is also important to link the problems concerning consumer contracts with work on contract law in its entirety within the context of the ongoing process aimed at developing common frameworks for European contract law.
Now we have a situation where President Obama has, quite correctly, decided to do away with it.

The country has also achieved good results in applying the developing EU acquis.
We need to find concrete answers and we also need to anticipate the consequences that this crisis will have on the financing of the economy, and on the economy itself.
Secondly, and this is particularly important for us: in future, we will have to have many common European agreements that apply to all 27 Member States and investors from these Member States if we are also to have a uniform level of protection within the European internal market.
That is the reason behind this solution, which I think makes a good deal of sense, namely to separate out the transport rules, which are easier to accept and, I hope, to implement.
Concerning Europol first of all, it would be difficult to stop Europol from becoming an agency.
Mr Costa has put an initial question: is the Commission satisfied with that situation and does it believe that the introduction of Regulation (EC) No 551/2004 on airspace organisation is progressing satisfactorily?
I am therefore very pleased to see the commitment shown by the UN Special Representative, Margot Wallström.
The European Parliament is therefore asking the European Commission to better coordinate the transferability of pensions at a European level.
Adjournment of the session
Firstly, we must do the job of regulating the financial sector properly.
Thank you.
Such awareness should increase our sense of responsibility, which should also extend to the Black Sea region.
Last week I called for a coordinated European response, because I am convinced that, without it, it will be much harder for Europe to overcome this crisis.
I would like to give you a couple of examples, particularly concerning Community law on the environment.
in writing. - (PT) I am happy to vote in favour of this amendment to the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) in order to extend the scope of its interventions in the housing sector so as to help marginalised communities in all the Member States.

The European Union needs to intervene in the work of the UN Human Rights Council.
Yes, we must bring up the territorial autonomy of the Székely people.

It is a social responsibility that should be borne collectively by the whole of society.
These factors are compounded by the inadequacy of the funds provided for the 2007-2013 period, particularly taking account of the enlargement of the EU, and the use of only 27.1% of available resources in the current period, as well as the continuation of national cofinancing and the administrative burden.
I would also like to thank the Chair, Mr Harbour, who, as has already been mentioned, has succeeded with great efficiency and by listening very carefully in setting nearly 11 parliamentary committees to work in a very short space of time.
Having said that, it has to be acknowledged that Turkey still does not fulfil all the objective criteria that would enable it to aspire to be a full member of the Union, and that the reforms that it has recently been making will take time to have the expected results.

I must say that there were some very similar thoughts or doubts about this proposal in the Council and Parliament.

The breakdown of constitutional order in Honduras brings an end to two decades without coups in Latin America and creates a bad precedent for other countries, and especially the weakest ones, such as Paraguay, currently.

The proof of this is that another Directive was adopted last year: the Floods Directive.
The present initiative aims to extend the definition of 'public figure', as laid down in Article 2 of Council Decision 2002/956/JHA, in order to cover any person, regardless of whether or not they hold an official position, who is deemed to be under threat due to their contribution to or impact on the public debate.

Where the state has failed to provide education for poor children, parents themselves have come together, finance non-state education and, therefore, are also able to subsidise the non-working poor.
It is contrary to the Lisbon Strategy and undermines the fundamental rights and values of the Union.
My group will vote against this report because it disregards that important principle.
The people may only vote to support what the EU elite want.
16.
At the same time, the European Investment Bank is a major source of loans and loan guarantees for the European small and medium-sized enterprise sector.
However, I also think that we must not demonise certain foods.
The Council and the Member States behave as if money that goes into the European budget more or less disappears into a large black hole.
I think these two further endorsements will, I hope, facilitate the Swedish Presidency to preside over the full ratification of the Lisbon Treaty.

Here, once again, international society is remaining silent and allowing Berlin and Washington to see their interests put into effect.

I am referring here to traffic congestion, air pollution, sound pollution, water pollution, soil pollution or the impact on natural landscapes.
I think that is the crux of the problem.
On the other hand this is a guarantee of stable income for our farmers.
(DE) Mr President, the extraordinarily dangerous Temelín nuclear power plant, at which there have already been 127 incidents since 2000, is very close to where I come from in Upper Austria and there is another close to Vienna at Mochovce in the Slovak Republic.
The point proposing a ban on smoking at work is incontrovertible.
Secondly, we must sustain sufficient instruments to safeguard against market and supply crises.

We all know that the European Union needs to strengthen its energy security and independence and to strengthen its energy infrastructure which means linking up and extending oil pipelines, gas pipelines and power lines between individual states and regions.
Fourthly, it would be important that at any stage during new negotiations it is possible to raise issues that have yet to be addressed at the current stage and that these topics are approved by the Commission.
We need to reenergise the process and, in that way, remind our constituents that the EU does not just bring regulation and red tape at a huge cost, but should, and can actually bring tangible benefits for businesses and trade as well as consumers and individuals.
There has been great success in that very small-scale programme because it is working from the ground up.
You know what I am referring to: the very disgraceful bullying of Ireland.
That is why it seems appropriate to me that the compromise will be adopted only following the revision of the regulation by January 2013 and only following the feasibility study and reassessment of the objectives.
The current crisis is an acid test, and we must understand its full significance.
Without policy coherence - and that is not just any coherence, but it is policy coherence for development as it is stated in Article 208 of the Lisbon Treaty - we will not get anywhere.
I welcome the participation of Members of the European Parliament at COP 9 and MOP 4, as they are called in the language we use in this context.

This federal project for Europe will strengthen the expression of a true European identity and help spread our cultural and linguistic diversity across the world.
(Applause)
From this point of view, it is still very difficult for the veterinary authorities in Romania to inspect animal transport without calling on the police, which is the only authority competent to stop means of transport in transit.
That is the result of prosperity, and two thirds of people in the world still live in poverty.
The latest developments and the initiatives taken by the Commission on the specific issues of the environment-health relationship are very significant; they show that alongside the cooperation developing on a mid- to long-term basis between the environment, health and research sectors, it is possible to take immediate measures to further incorporate the health dimension into environment policy, with benefits to both the environment and health.
I would say in Mr Vondra's presence that we will naturally work closely with the Czech Presidency.
Besides, these two sections would sound the death knell for a large number of carriers of passengers by inland waterway, as they would be unable to afford the associated exorbitant insurance premiums, assuming anyone would insure them given a level of liability such as this.
As for the United Kingdom and the banks, people often say to me: 'Mr Brown has done more than you have'.
I would also thank the rapporteur for taking the trouble to find solutions to help us surmount certain problems that various Member States have owing to different judicial cultures.
We cannot therefore be content with a minimalist solution in line with the US proposal, which would generate a few billion euro - a relatively small revenue considering the huge costs.

Therefore, the report of Edite Estrela is really timely.
You need to structure and galvanise the process and provide sufficient coordinated information to the citizens of Europe.
Making our energy strategy more sustainable will require a continued focus on renewable energy, through the introduction of increased competition within the sector in order to achieve the effective implementation of the internal market for energy.
Germany must honour the resolution we are discussing, which says that the EU must be united in its action with respect to Russia in large-scale energy projects.
Request for the waiver of Mr Elmar Brok's parliamentary immunity (
I spoke to him not long ago.
If Mercosur succeeds in achieving a deal with the EU, why should these countries continue to participate in WTO negotiations?
That, at least, would be money well spent.
In regions like Nordjylland that are particularly dependent on one sector, market recovery and the redeployment of workers in other areas of activity tend to be slower and more difficult.
Unfortunately, as the current debate has also shown, the beginnings of the Hungarian Presidency are turbulent.
The role of the European Parliament is undoubtedly, inter alia, to consider every case where there may be a violation of human rights, which may also result from membership of particular social groups.

Mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund: application EGF/2010/019 IE/Construction 41 from Ireland (
When the Commission states in its proposal that these payments may have to be graduated, that modulation into the second pillar must be introduced - as here the funds produce better results in terms of workers, the environment - then this is a foretaste of what lies ahead, namely the discussion following the publication of this information.
In relation to the progressive displacement of domestic production by more competitively priced imports from China, we can see negative social effects, which especially concern those regions that have for centuries specialised in the manufacture of clothes.
With the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union must not only respect the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) but also use it as a basis for establishing laws at EU level that offer protection to suspects and defendants in accordance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
I would like to underline that this is a principle according to which a person found irregularly on the territory of a Member State is returned to the state of first entry into the EU.

rapporteur. - (NL) Madam President, I would like to express my sincere thanks to my fellow Members for their input into the debate and for the support I have received for various points in my report.
It is not for the President to interrupt in the way that you have just done.
Secondly, the data is collected by private companies, which make it available to the Commission, and these private companies' main customers are in the gas and oil industries, an area of business that involves a degree of speculation.
in writing. - The resolution focuses, in particular, on: (1) the regulatory environment, calling for better implementation of the SME test - in particular, in Member States - and for a reduction in bureaucracy and administrative burdens; (2) improving SMEs' access to finance through additional funding and instruments within the EIB (such as the RSFF and equity financing) and an enlarged (and independent) CIP; (3) improvements needed to ensure the participation of SMEs in public procurement; (4) simplification and better targeted R&D&I programmes to promote SMEs' innovation management capacity, access to R&D&I services and knowledge-based business services, through, for instance, technology transfer centres and universities; (5) the need for more attention to be paid to skills needed and other social and labour market issues affecting entrepreneurship and SMEs' capacities to fulfil their employment potential, in particular, managerial skills, digital skills and sustainability skills; (6) action to improve resource efficiency: sectoral SME projects to identify resource efficiency innovation in the value and supply chains; the adoption of an ambitious eco-innovation action plan and more funds for it through the CIP; more cost-effective energy efficiency measures to help SMEs reduce energy bills;
In my view, there are two main aspects that the review should focus on in particular: overcoming the problems related to the burden and complexity of administrative procedures, as a result of which those seeking European financing are diverted towards national financing.
Those affected by such a tragedy expect swift and efficient assistance, as well as good coordination of the measures taken.
Here I want to commend the Ombudsman on his new website.
I voted for the recommendation on the conditions for Swiss participation in the Youth in Action programme and in the Lifelong Learning programme because I consider it a positive factor in European youth strategy; this is because it is a stage in the cooperation process with this country on sectoral policies within the European Union.
Thousands of square kilometres of land are now free of landmines thanks to the work of people taking great risks in Bosnia, Angola and many other countries.
This is another point that needs to be made forcefully in the present debate.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, there is, however, something strange in all of this.
Madam President, Commissioner, at the start of our term of office we were all striving to increase funds for the implementation of EU tasks.
Most of the amendments dealt with horizontal issues, like the inclusion of gender and age in the breakdown variables and the use of additional and complementary financing provided by certain Community programmes in the two areas covered by the regulation.
Three months have already passed since the disaster in Japan, and we still do not know how all of the issues will be addressed.
I agree that in order to fully realise the EU 2020 flagship initiative 'An Agenda for new skills and jobs', the EU institutions should embark on a more pragmatic, comprehensive and wide-ranging initiative supported by all Member States which should focus on connecting the areas of vocational education, professional qualifications, lifelong learning, apprenticeships and the labour market.
Furthermore, a good deal of confusion persists about the guarantee of Internet neutrality and the safeguarding of users' fundamental rights.
Europe's new strategy must be based on a redefinition of the resources available for the Mediterranean, provide for an increase in financial commitments to facilitate political, economic and social reform in the countries of the region, and press for resources relating to immigration.
Given that the US is committed to this approach for all their FTAs, Europe must achieve similarly strict enforcement measures.
This provides countries with the information and the means to stop unwanted imports of toxic chemicals, putting the requirement and onus on the exporter/exporting country to comply with the laws of the importing country.
(Posiedzenie zostało otwarte o godz.
Departure from the historical criteria of distribution would not only be a symbolic gesture of fuller integration, but would also contribute to ensuring equal conditions of competition in a single Community market.

Indeed, innovation is an integral part of both the Commission's climate change package and the plan for revitalising the European economy.
Unfortunately the negotiations that will now be entered into with the Council are not likely to correct our aim, in an EU in which the good of the Union as a whole is rarely able to withstand national egotism.
I am thinking about pay: it is, at last, expressly stated that remuneration cannot be lower than that which the law recognises for all other European citizens.
This new regulation proposes that we harmonise these rules of conflict of laws.
The report's obsession with climate change could lead to accepting advice that obliges arable farmers to pump tractor exhaust under the ground, increasing fuel consumption and spoiling seabeds as a consequence.
I think this will be the key element in future negotiations.
As is well known, the United States and Russia are developing a new alternative to the Convention: controlled and self-destructing mines.
A day will come when the peoples of Asia, of the Americas and of Africa will get together.
On the first point, in particular that of giving Member States more responsibility, I would also like to draw attention to the fact that the lack of harmonisation between national systems creates significant differences in terms of the amount of time needed to verify cases of fraud and irregularity.
But the increase in demand for wilderness tourism puts pressure on the very same values that the tourists are seeking and can speed up the destruction of fragile ecosystems.
It is rooted in the social and environmental spheres.
Although it is important for achieving the goals of this strategy, cohesion and regional policy should be independent and provide a framework for establishing strong synergies between all European policies.
On the one hand, I recall that in the last 14 or 15 years, this has not been the case, since the European Court of Auditors did not feel able to approve the execution of the annual budgets.
The professions in question can be perfectly well filled by our own workers.
The conclusion of bilateral fisheries agreements between the European Community and non-member countries, termed 'Fisheries Partnership Agreements' (FPA), has been standard practice under the common fisheries policy (CFP) and is central to the policy's external dimension.
The results of the study should be available in the third quarter of 2009.
The Taiwanese Government under President Ma responded promptly by deploying soldiers to the worst-affected communities and areas, and requesting assistance from the international community.
Therefore, it is imperative to invest in internal staff training and lifelong learning.
I think the oral question is very clear.
It is, however, unacceptable to use this cause in order to force the introduction of fundamental and non-negotiable human values, as is the case with the right to life.
We need simple and clear rules, consistently and rigorously applied'.
In recent years, we have seen those forces working together with very good results.
There is a constant increase in demand for the development of services linked to modern technology and for high-quality services meeting the standards and expectations of their users.
I would like to inform you that Written Declaration 0054/2009 by Mrs Lynne, Mrs Jędrzejewska and Mr Schlyter on the transportation of horses for slaughter in the European Union was signed today, 24 February 2010, by a majority of Parliament's component Members. Therefore, in accordance with Rule 124(4) of the Rules of Procedure, it will be forwarded to its addressees and published with the names of its signatories in the Texts Adopted of the sitting of 25 February 2010.
The costs resulting from urban traffic congestion are rising to approximately 1% of European GDP.
The European Union can be competitive only insofar as internal policies bolster its capacity to respond to today's challenges.
They discourage individual initiatives in favour of competition among dealers and repairers and encourage the development of the sector.
That is why we have digital tachographs that automatically record driving hours, and the authorities monitor compliance with this.
The Commission promotes policies to combat the exclusion of vulnerable groups, and this therefore includes, in particular, people in custody.
In reality, there was no need to clarify this because in various judgments involving France, the United Kingdom and Poland, the European Court of Human Rights had already ruled that in the areas of life, the value of life, respect for life and the family, it must be left up to the Member States to decide according to their history, tradition and culture.
We have a year of tough negotiations ahead of us.
An innovation policy that is consistent and integrated, and has a long-term vision will enable us to leverage strengths and resolve weaknesses detected at regional level.
At present, the US has not made a formal request.
Today, on that anniversary, we are debating a new war which has broken out, but this new war was one which we - the European Union - have been able to stop very quickly.
There is no doubt that violence against women violates their basic rights and fundamental freedoms, in particular the right to security and human dignity.
In particular, it was successive presidencies, and principally the Czech Presidency and the current Swedish Presidency, as they were responsible for the second and third readings.
The line taken by Parliament, as indicated by rapporteur Jędrzejewska, is very clear.
Ladies and gentlemen, today I have tried to outline some of the challenges we face in the future.
The Commission clearly recognises the importance that bees play in the EU's ecology and its ecosystem.
We firmly believe that we can make much better use of the cooperation between entrepreneurs in the cultural sector, on the one hand, and academia, both higher education - universities and higher education colleges - and secondary education, on the other, and that they offer a lot more opportunities than we are currently utilising.
(NL) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I share the great concern of many in this House about the fate of Opel and the people who work there or make a living in that area.
Although the mission sent to observe the 2006 Palestinian elections recognised the legitimacy of their result, the European Union and its Member States chose to boycott the elected government, just as they boycotted the government of national unity formed thereafter to break that deadlock.
Nor shall we let anyone, whether inside or outside the European Union, set limits on our resolute defence of human rights.
I say will punish, using the future, as unfortunately, and this is an appeal to your sensibility, between April and now the reservations of the national parliaments of some Member States have not been withdrawn with the result that the procedure leading to the entry into force of this European law to punish racism and xenophobia has been blocked.
Unfortunately, it is not very satisfactory because, at a time when we are witnessing several Member States pursuing a rash immigration policy that grants large numbers of foreigners lawful residence in the EU, and when the lack of border control allows people to move freely across borders, there is a need for stronger border control between the EU's Member States on a permanent basis.
Please look at it again.
(DE) Mr President, the United States and Europe are the West's companions in fate.
Perhaps it comes down to whether one regards the glass as half-full or half-empty.
I strongly condemn this gang rape, as well as other human rights violations, and I welcome the request made to the United Nations and the DRC Government that it undertake an impartial and thorough investigation of all incidents, and guarantee that those responsible for violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law be held to account for their actions and prosecuted under the terms of international law.
Agenda for next sitting: see Minutes
I would be grateful if Parliament's Bureau could advise on the necessary measures.
These people come because we need them.
This is something where the Commission can really ask for an improvement when it comes to European statistics.
Some of what has been said today in this House should be put into perspective by viewing it in the light of history.
I want to see an EU with a humane asylum and immigration policy that protects immigrants and their rights.
Given that we have managed to discuss the problems we are facing within the European Union in a vote that divided this House and split it in two, and which has given us a lot of work over the past two months, we can now confront President Lukashenko of Belarus with our heads held high.
A Member noted that we have time constraints, but let me point out that the first proposal - the general animal health law - that will come into force is scheduled for 2010, not 2013 as was mentioned.
The countries of the European Union are experiencing the crisis now; Europe needs new jobs now; support for new entrepreneurship initiatives is needed right away.
Now you are going to force European workers to compete not only against each other, but against immigrant workers, too.
It would be good if we could identify the opportunities inherent in this problem; if we could shift our perception of the Roma issue from problem to opportunity.
President of the Commission. - Mr Zahradil, first of all, unfortunately, the economic problems that we have in Europe are not only in the euro area.
In order to ensure the continued security of international transport, especially in the face of the risk posed by terrorism, it is vital for countries to be able to exchange information on passengers - PNR data, collected by airlines.
Those, Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, are the main points due to be discussed at next week's European Council: a busy and important agenda indeed.

The original European Commission proposal that this directive would apply to all airports with passenger numbers greater than one million per annum was extremely worrying, particularly from an Irish viewpoint, because, if this approach had been adopted, then the directive would have applied to both Shannon and Cork airports, and possibly, in due course, to Ireland West Airport as it seeks to continue its expansion operations.
- Madam President, I do not hold with the notion that our economic salvation lies in tiny value added tax cuts, which are something we have had in the United Kingdom with, frankly, only a marginal positive impact.

In other words, the euro zone has indeed equipped itself with the means to decide democratically on its exchange policy.

With the end of milk quotas, the end of a proper agricultural budget as part of the 2014-2019 financial framework, and the retirement of the majority of producers, not to be replaced, the end of the great CAP was planned for 2013 - it was as simple as that.
The errors observed by the Court of Auditors are not a result of attempts to defraud on the part of the project promoters, but a result of the complexity of the conditions for eligibility.

I think an apology is warranted from Mr Schulz.
That is in progress at the moment, of course, but are the traditional minorities also included in this?

That is why it is very important that he or she is present not only at the European but at the national level as well, especially in countries where democratic principles and supervision are still in the process of being built and where government structures cannot provide effective remedy for their citizens at the national level, yet those citizens are also citizens of the European Union.
Parliament is the conscience of Europe and this conscience must not be silenced by any pronouncements by any minister holding office in the European Union.

Article 5 of the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic could not be clearer.

However, in the course of 20 years, the context of these negotiations has changed profoundly.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has discussed and approved its report in a short space of time so as to allow today's vote here to take place, and so that the next step towards the agreement with the Council can be taken as soon as possible and thus allow the new provisions of this directive to enter into force.

I voted in favour of this document, because the early years of childhood (pre-school) are critical for cognitive, sensory and motor development and language acquisition, and also lay the foundations for lifelong learning.

If the outside world and non-specialists in this area are also to understand what this is all about, since this is a very technically complex subject matter that nevertheless concerns a democratic institution and serves to eliminate the so-called democratic deficit in Europe, we should point out the following: What this means is that Parliament and the Council, the two legislative powers of the European Union, cannot on their own deal with every matter of detail.
I am glad that there were no proposals for the introduction of legislative measures in the area of energy poverty.

The role and future of macro-regional strategies may be related to the debate over the future use of European funds, although in our view, it is unnecessary for today's debate to extend into a discussion on the future architecture of the cohesion policy and the anticipation of potential financial allocations designated for individual states in the coming financial perspective.
Against this backdrop, we must ask ourselves two questions.
Thank you again for the high quality of the debate.

Also, reducing the speed limit will allow us to fight the greenhouse effect.
How can we reinforce controls?
In an effort to see this great institutional theatre of Europe also become the cradle of such diversities and such autonomous identities as those which I hope for in the Europe of the regions that we shall learn to celebrate in the future, I therefore call, Mr President, for more and more people to come to prominence through the use of our languages, too.
I call on the Commission to be strong and committed towards an agreement based on the European Parliament resolution and the 12 conditions you mentioned before, bearing in mind that without complete agreement from both sides, Albania's European integration process might be completely frozen.

Therefore it was all the more incomprehensible to us all when the rapporteur in the Committee on Budgetary Control did not want to grant discharge for three of the four agencies, for the most incredible reasons - particularly as, even if they were valid, the agencies themselves were not responsible for those points, for example staff regulations relating to temporary staff of the institution, or the location of the head office of the relevant agency, or even the way the principle of subsidiarity was observed.
Mr Verhofstadt has provided the correct justification for this.
Where Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev are concerned, I would state that these individuals must at last be freed - otherwise the state visit by the Russian President to the European Parliament will take place under a huge cloud.

The trouble is that these organisations lack democratic legitimacy, and that is very dangerous.
If we can ensure that the cooperation is friendly, but also serious, and if we do not forget to make legitimate demands and highlight legitimate failings, we will be making a step in the right direction, not only in terms of the cooperation between Europe and Russia, but, most importantly, in terms of human rights.
It was recognised then, and recognised now, that these laws lead to censorship and the promotion of discrimination and homophobia: discrimination and homophobia which destroys people's lives and blights the souls of those who practise it.

It also condemns the use of brutal force by the police and KGB services against the protesters on election day and, in particular, expresses its indignation over a brutal attack on Uladzimir Niakliayeu - examples of the severe violation of basic democratic principles such as freedom of assembly and freedom of expression, as well as of human rights, and it expresses its concern at the attempts by the Belarusian authorities to take into state custody Danil Sannikov, three-year-old son of presidential candidate, Andrei Sannikov, and investigative journalist, Irina Khalip, both of whom have been jailed since the 19 December election.

I think that EURES could be used not only in order to inform and improve the security for those who would like to move to another country and another labour market, as Mr Andersson pointed out here earlier today, but it could also be used in order to inform all the decision-making institutions of the remaining obstacles we have in the European labour markets because the gap between vision and theory on the one hand and the reality is quite big.
I tried to speak dozens of times, and also handed in my request, but was ignored. I believe that what the President in the chair before you has just done is contrary to the rules of this House and unworthy of this Parliament.

The time has come for us to switch our attention from large enterprises, which are loud, I should not like to say - like children - but they are loud, and pay attention to the quieter ones, most of whom work after all with the small ones.

(ES) Madam President, Mr Saryusz-Wolski should be congratulated because his report clearly states the essential points that the Union should take into account in order to establish a genuine common foreign policy on energy: reciprocity with exporting countries, the need to better coordinate our energy diplomacy at European level, and the importance of establishing an integrated and competitive market.
It is high time to apply an objective method to the assessment of totalitarian crimes. We can make use of the experience of the European Court of Human Rights.
(PL) Madam President, the debate on the report on human rights in the world has coincided with sad events which confirm that human rights are constantly being violated.
You should not be having to apply.

This we can say straight away.

In the version amended by Parliament and the Council, the sale of paint strippers containing dichloromethane to consumers will be banned completely.

We must really limit exceptions to structurally weak regions and define them for very tightly limited production quantities.
Now we will not even achieve 20%.
Overall, our relations have improved over the last two years.
(DE) Mr President, with regard to the disaster of the budget negotiations for 2011, I would like to say: firstly, the right to draw up a budget is a central right of any democratic parliament. Secondly, a parliament that takes itself seriously must exercise this right.
I would like to highlight the fact that the changes do not just concern the influence of individual states on EU processes, but also the fundamental principles themselves, on which the EU was established 50 years ago.
Those pushing the unscientific nonsense of man-made climate change - Shell, Monsanto, the international banks, Bilderberg one-worlders, carbon billionaires and their useful idiot allies on the left - are running the biggest fraud in human history.
We believe we have to take practical steps: a comprehensive test ban treaty should come into force; the fissile material cut-off; support for peaceful uses of nuclear energy to find safe ways of making sure that we avoid proliferation - for example, the contributions we make to the nuclear fuel bank - and support for a very strong and effective IAEA.
That must not happen.
Anyone who deplores the lack of or insufficient European culture in the world, which they have every reason to do, can only welcome the MEDIA Mundus programme and vote in favour of it enthusiastically.

No doubt the concentration of the chemicals in these products has increased but for consumers, this is compatible with the present GHS solution because we know that people use these products every day, so we did not need to overclassify them.
I would say yes, but mostly perhaps in the sense that people realised in the last 24 hours that if they did not show the will to compromise, there would be a real risk of not getting anything done, and the whole process would risk dying.
This proposal on the single permit act is very important, and therefore we hope to come to an agreement very soon.

I voted against this report.
In my view, however, the big news of the day is not this agreement.
It is a pleasure for me to inform you that Hungary, too, will become part of this programme next year and is prepared to participate in the resettlement programme.
Another waste of money: how many billions is this House of History going to cost, to sell propaganda and tell how the European Union 'saved the world'?

The fact that today's result is significantly better - and I would like to thank specifically Mrs Gurmai, Mrs Wallis, Mr Lamassoure and Mr Häfner for working closely together and making such good progress on refining this regulation - is also due to the many members of civil society who have subjected our considerations and our debates to repeated reality and practicability checks.

The debate is closed.
We shall still be able to draw up a resolution on the results after the summit, but this Parliament, which wants to be political, should also adopt political freedom of expression by a majority before the summit in order to show mainland Russia what we think about freedom and democracy here in the European Parliament.
As the European Parliament, we should, indeed, look at what the Commission is saying today.

I should also like to reiterate the firm intention of the Commission to continue its efforts on the Environment and Health Action Plan.
I support Ms Lulling's recommendations that the national systems should recognise the importance of protecting self-employed workers, and we should stand against all forms of discrimination, but I am still not convinced that this House is best placed to work on employment matters.
In comparison to this kind of ambitious scenario that we would like to see, the insistence of Parliament on a strong chapter in the FTA on sustainable development is absolutely the minimum we need in terms of deciding whether or not this House can give its assent to the upcoming agreement.
Europe should not allow this.
One of the first ways to solve the problem can be implemented in schools.
Strengthening social cohesion and eradicating poverty and social exclusion must be political priorities for the European Union and its Member States.
We have already discussed the fact that in India last year there were five million more people with a new diet that is based much more on milk, milk products and meat.

It is now for the Commission to size up this call.
We need Russia if we are to be able to deal with the global challenges effectively.
Yes, this is how it really is.
Mr President, as far as the Treaty is concerned, the devil is not in the detail, he is in the ratification.

I believe that in 2010, particular attention should be focused on programmes for training young entrepreneurs and for supporting them in setting up their own companies.

It calls for a public debate about urban planning in Spain, which will allow legislative measures to be adopted against speculation and unsustainable development, and will put an end to à la carte legislation practised in autonomous regions such as Aragón and Valencia.
I think we need to ensure multi-disciplinary teaching programmes and insist on cooperation and partnership not only between educational institutions, students and professionals in the cultural and creative sector, but also between businesses of all sizes, between the public and the private sector, and between craftspeople and financial institutions.
Through the negotiations we had many discussions with NGOs and industry and came up with a proposal which is excellent.

Unfortunately the world is awash with lost opportunities, with shipwrecked good ideas.
She is willing to send her underlings, but she is not willing to have a democratic cross-examination by this House.
I voted for this report because we must debate the measures adopted at European and national level on social and territorial cohesion which aim to fulfil the objectives of EU policies, including that of increasing global economic competitiveness.
Today's vote, which confirmed the release of EUR 35.6 million for these departments, as well as EUR 31.2 million for Portugal, which suffered flooding in Madeira caused by this storm, is an example of this common desire to show true solidarity between European citizens.
I am sure that those on the other side of the Atlantic are concerned as well, so that is why I think we should work together on increasing cyber security, always respecting the fundamental freedoms - because freedom of expression is a sacred right for us in the European Union - while being clear that data protection and privacy are also fundamental rights.
It is then in the hands of Parliament and the Council to see whether it is possible to spend some of this money.
The report by Mrs Frassoni is aimed at strengthening what I would call the backbone of the Commission, so that the Commission is aware of the importance of this task, and so that, even if we want a prior phase of negotiation with governments on the difficulties that may arise, at the moment of truth the Commission acts as the citizens expect, with strength and vigour, and applying Community law.
(NL) Today, we are discussing Europe's economy from a long-term perspective, and how to achieve sustainable economic growth.

The airline Wizzair refused to allow the dog on board, even though their regulations state that it is possible to transport guide dogs belonging to blind or deaf persons, and the online purchase of the ticket also included the dog.

I believe that interinstitutional cooperation should be improved as regards translation, interpretation, recruitment (EPSO) and EMAS and should be extended to other areas.
In this chamber, in front of MEPs who today represent the democratic governments of Europe, democratic parties and democratic sentiments, I have heard people say: 'You know, we have stepped in to solve the problem where Mr Ahtisaari failed.'

The foundations of a strong Union and a successful future are built on trust and mutual accommodation, just like in a family.

It is necessary to adopt several key measures.
There is still work to be done.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Dirk Sterckx, for his efforts on the directive on reporting formalities for ships arriving in, or departing from, ports.
Administrative cooperation is a way to supplement national legislations, but we need to remember that it will never replace them or result in their approximation.
The report also proposes acknowledging the stepping up of the European fight against piracy and supporting the growing effectiveness of Operation Atalanta, as well as the need to improve the quality of ship design in order to adapt them to the highest accessibility and safety standards.
In Belarus, elections are not free, there is no freedom of expression, association or demonstration, and repression by the authorities is increasing.
This is why, after this directive, we are asking for and anticipating from the Commission that the next step will be to extend protection to victims in this common area of justice and security.
The next item is the short presentation of the report by Hella Ranner, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on penalties for serious infringements against the social rules in road transport.
Mr President, yes I agree, it is very important that we have independent economic impact assessments of EU regulations.
If the European Union is to be truly democratic and close to its citizens, close cooperation is required at local, regional and national level between the Union's institutions and its Member States on the one hand and civil society on the other.
More than anything else, early intervention is crucial.
(PL) Madam President, democracy in Europe is based on providing effective protection for fundamental rights and ensuring that they are promoted.

Mr President, good afternoon to you all.
On that occasion, President Yusuf made a strong appeal for international assistance to support a better, secure environment for people living in Somalia.
I cannot reply within one minute to all the comments that I have heard, but I would like to say, with regard to Russia, that as Mr Severin knows, the report recommends constructive cooperation, but naturally without prejudice to human rights and international law.

The European Union should stop exposing itself voluntarily to the problems of US financial policy.
I agree with Parliament that the importance of our ports is linked not only to economic factors but also to the role of ports in society.
We believe that this is another important decision that the Council must take.
Here I would say that postponing the execution of such a decision would greatly undermine and possibly negate the purpose of the proposed legislation.
Indeed, this is also why Parliament is insisting on our introducing a separate budget line for the 'Small Business Act' and, in particular, a budget line for climate change.

Equally, we need - and this is also the appeal we have made to the Commission - a strategy which allows us to conserve the rich ecosystems in our natural parks, be it the Bauges, Ardèche or Lubéron, with the whole undertaking relying on funding designed for preventive measures and actions to re-establish the damaged ecosystem.
(DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I assume that today we are holding a debate on policy strategy for the last time in this form because we are to have a new model in the Treaty of Lisbon.
In fact, at the first reading of this report when it was adopted by Parliament with a large majority, it was stressed that we need to launch a broad debate on the labelling of textile products, including the issue of origin marking and we proposed to extend the scope of the regulation to certain sectors.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposals by Mr Grosch are aimed at the uniform and stringent application of road transport regulations, which I support; I agree that criteria ought to be laid down which should have to be met before these activities can be carried out, and that surveillance by the relevant authorities should be stepped up through a single document recognition system and a system of sanctions, and that permission must be sought from the countries that these services cross.
I believe that the people who have been affected appreciate the solidarity shown by the European institutions and by you in person, with the condolences expressed and the minute of silence, and they will also appreciate any financial and legislative support for reconstruction.
And of course I cannot fail to mention the forthcoming summit on the Barcelona Process and the Mediterranean Union, which will take place in Paris on 13 July.

To close - and I am sorry that I do not have more time to reply to the very specific issues raised - I should just like to say before I forget, because a number of speakers referred to the economic recovery programmes, that they are indeed a very good idea, because there are numerous benefits from including projects to prevent disasters which we can more or less expect to happen next year as well - as previously said, we discuss these matters every year - both because they will generate economic activity and create more jobs and because they will prevent damage costing millions of euros in restoration works.
In other respects, we should praise Egypt very much for its important role in the last weeks and days for its efforts and hard work on achieving a ceasefire and maybe even an armistice with, at the very end of the process, peace in the region.
There was some justification for the inequalities under the production subsidies system, which favoured farmers who produced more.

So, to possibly already have decided that, come what may, negotiations will be reopened, even before the Summit has taken place, does not show the greatest diplomatic skill.

It is like 1989 and the European Union needs special procedures - this House, the Commission, the Council, the EAS - and we welcome Cathy Ashton's down payment for democracy, but we need to do more.

(DE) Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, human rights, liberty and equality are far too important for all of us to allow games to be played with them, for them to be put in the balance against powerful interests, and for commercial interests perhaps to take precedence over these values that are so important.

Pending this, the EU Member States should implement unilateral actions to prohibit the use and transfer of these bombs, as many states have already done and others are preparing to do.

I hope that this debate will also serve as an input to the leaders' meeting tomorrow and on Friday.

This extra cost represents roughly the coverage of expenditures for one quarter, while we have seen that the setting up of the service is still at the 10% level.

I am also delighted that, on this very day, the relevant regulation has been signed guaranteeing a practical start-up of the EGNOS and Galileo programmes.

The Council and Member States have to support together the European and national commitment to deepening and strengthening the Single Market.
In the words of a compatriot of the Commissioner, Mr Tajani, the chairman, Mr Costa, and Antonio Gramsci, in these discussions we are seeking to balance the pessimism of our intelligence with the optimism of our will.
The debate is closed.
One important aspect relates to the deregulation of services, especially with regard to modes 3 and 4.

We must emphatically underline that it is not purely economic in character.
The Commission has therefore proposed clearer definitions of the concepts of 'workers' information' and 'workers' consultation' and a clarification of how these activities correlate at various levels.

If the attacks on the civilian population continue, and that seems to be the case, the EU must negotiate a UN mandate and action to create a nofly zone over Libya to avoid a human catastrophe.
Enhanced cooperation must then be authorised by the Council, following consultation with or assent from Parliament, depending on the situation.
Europe's cultural potential must be used strategically.
We are expecting definite intervention from the EU.
The Conference of Presidents is responsible for the order of business, and we will discuss the matter this Thursday.

Like everything excessive, it is ridiculous.
I have the impression that there is the possibility today of ending Mrs Haidar's hunger strike and finding a solution for her.
Some of my fellow Members here have echoed this and that is why they signed.
Given the introduction of that protection, and the value of the underlying principle of this legislation, I strongly support the compromise.
I should like now to thank everyone here for all the speeches and suggestions you have made and to say that I have taken note of them and of your concerns, particularly those of what I would call a more social nature, that is, the possible consequences that the recent financial turbulence might have for citizens.
Also, from a general point of view, the chapter on investment must respect both parties' right to legislate in areas such as the environment, public health, employee and consumer rights, industrial policy and cultural diversity, among others.
Particular attention must be focused on removing all those difficulties that hamper access to Community funds and discourage people from obtaining EU financial support.

See how hypocrisy has been elevated into a governing principle!

As my fellow Members in this Chamber have mentioned, we must quickly rid the system of all types of fraud and help the business sector as much as we can to eliminate the barriers that the current system creates.
I would like to congratulate the Presidency on addressing the issue of disabilities at a high level until the end of the trio.
It so happens that I have been a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control at a crucial time, and I thank you for the changes that you have made, because they are a great help to us.
I have therefore supported amendments to exempt airports in the outermost regions from the new regime, and look forward to the production of a framework that takes account of the fragile nature of many communities.
The Council declared that ACP countries and regions, if they so wished, could depart where necessary from the provisions agreed by other countries or regions during EPA negotiations.
In particular we should ensure that the Framework Decision is also applied to national data processing; otherwise the point of the entire proposal is called into question.
Similarly, the Commission cannot accept weakening a woman's right to refuse night work.
(EL) Mr President, obviously, I, too, support the provision of humanitarian aid by the European Union as and where possible.
Over the last nine years, 77 European airline companies have gone bankrupt.
Naturally, I support the Swedish position on the issue - namely that the decision on abortion is ultimately a decision for the woman concerned, not a matter for the legislators.
(NL) Mr President, we have a real emergency in Europe.
I therefore encourage the Commission to continue the ambitious strategy it was able to carry out when it concluded a free trade agreement with South Korea.
The institutions and instruments that govern this Union are appropriate, especially if we take into account the improvements introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon.
- Before the vote on Amendment 7:
I believe that we are at risk of doing more harm than good with this resolution because no attention is being paid to the efforts which Morocco is making to achieve a lasting, just solution to the Western Sahara conflict.
Parliament also addressed the Commission about the delays in the proposed European Charter on Volunteering, which is expected to define better the role of volunteering.
On the one hand, I am personally delighted with the reinforcement of the role of the national parliaments and the national executives through the so-called flexibility clause.
In my view, both the EU and the US need to rethink and probably redefine the transatlantic partnership to adapt to the new situation.
I firmly believe that, on the basis of the tasks, objectives, principles and instruments defined by all the Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and furthermore based on the shared competences as well as the supporting, coordinating and complementary actions of the Union, a very strong strategy on Roma inclusion can come into existence.
I also voted in favour, because I agree that it is unacceptable for an organisation financed by Europe not to have sound and transparent management of its finances after so many years.
Detailed analyses of needs and the associated cost analyses will enable us to keep within the financial framework and at the same time should ensure that Parliament functions smoothly and that the new tasks can be handled.
I would urge you to oppose any proposal which might be used to legalise any whaling for scientific purposes and commercial whaling on the coast and elsewhere or equally to allow international trade in whale products.
However, is the European Union ready to commit 0.3% of its GDP to its policy for halting biodiversity loss and to convince the OECD countries to do the same?

We see the new generations being bombarded by the fast-food chains - I will not name them all here today - which are spreading throughout the European Union.
As soon as we receive these documents, we will be able to prepare our draft opinions and recommendations for each country, so that they can be adopted before the June European Council, which will mark the end of the very first European semester.
It is a fact that this sort of action reduces the operating costs of companies, increases their profitability, and possibly makes a positive contribution towards maintaining jobs.
What are you doing in the interim?
At least one woman should be appointed to these.
Secondly, when it comes to amendments, these are now prohibited for own-initiative reports.
It is impossible to be a little in favour of the free expression of opinion.
After Parmalat and Enron, we asked the Commission and Council in 2003-2006 to speak out on rating agencies.
The European Commission and the European Parliament should regain their strategic role and go for brave European solutions.
Of course we have to see what is the appropriate level of using the European dimension - the subsidiarity issue that was raised by some of you - but I think that we can agree that even the biggest Member States alone cannot face all those challenges and that we need some level of European commitment.
At a time when Europe is considering a common strategy for its supply of raw materials and especially rare earths, we cannot overlook the huge potential that the intelligent recovery of our waste offers.
They will have to balance Economic and Monetary Union.

We must step up our efforts to persuade the Turkish army to supply information to the competent committee in order to put an end to the suffering of the missing persons' relatives.
We have consulted each other, some groups have proposed a resolution and we have fortunately come to a joint resolution.
Firstly, the fact that you hold the Presidency has more than merely symbolic value.
After all we are not dealing with just any chemicals; the list of chemicals contains the most hazardous chemicals used by man on earth today.
However, with regard to the recycling of rare earth elements, and the question asked by Mr Rinaldi during his speech, I can answer by explaining the recycling measures that we as the European Commission intend to take.
If you really want the floor, I will now have to give it to you but please do not just ask for the floor just to express some kind of disagreement with the process.
We are satisfied with the way in which we dealt with finance together, a common concern within such an important plan.
Many EU countries, including Sweden, have also largely coped with the low birth rate and the demographic problems, partly through a well-developed welfare policy and through immigration.
I think we should support the Commission proposal, and, to those who think that this could be destabilising, I would like to say that stability will come with European integration.
Next, this unilateral recognition is in serious danger of going against the EU's stated objectives in the Balkans.
The relationship is based on deep economic integration: 40% of Turkey's foreign trade goes to the EU and 80% of foreign direct investments in Turkey come from the EU.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I greatly appreciate the work carried out by the two rapporteurs.
He also served as Chairman of the Socialist Group between 1979 and 1984.
As we heard from our Members, and the many points of view expressed, it has been a successful presidency.
This flexible structure will allow us to rise to the challenges at EU level.
The Ministry of Interior, together with certain private companies, are ripping off Bulgarian taxpayers, they are robbing them systematically, and then on a huge scale.
I also wish to congratulate the Portuguese Presidency for arranging and organising this summit - as I feel it was urgently needed - and especially for its great success.
The whole region is in need of democratic development and support from the European Union.
By means of Mr Frattini's phone call and of statements by Mr Maroni, the Italian Government has signified that it does not want to take any legislative measures that contravene European legal standards in any way.
This report sends a very positive message by drawing our attention to how to respond in this area at local level: how to respond specifically to local needs.
The rules are the same as ever: one minute for a question, one minute for an answer and, in the event that any of the political group chairs wish to ask an additional question, another question and answer lasting 30 seconds each.
Once again, as well as what is called for in this particular resolution, I would call on each and every one of us, as responsible individuals, also to take action in communicating our distress on this particular case.
Mr President, Mr Barroso observed that we are living in extraordinary times - true - but extraordinary times call for extraordinary leadership.
As a Parliament we need now to move away from words and provide concrete actions that can support India's needs.
He responded to concerns expressed on the reopening of talks with the Mercosur countries and, while his words brought some comfort to those who listened - because he said he would ensure that the interests of EU farming and the EU farm model would be safeguarded - I am afraid I was not reassured.
These are the biggest deficiencies.
He has our clear support to lead the Commission for another term.
Why not battle groups?
The European Court of Human Rights is not in Luxembourg.
What is a covenant?
For this reason, we should take particular care to ensure that this policy is developed in line with economic, social and cultural interests.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioners, I would like to come back to the anti-counterfeiting agreement which is currently being negotiated, in particular, with the United States.
(PL) Mr President, much has been said and there have been many discussions in recent years about the role of women, their rights, their position in society and their occupational situation.
President-in-Office of the Council. - In the new Member States you have different conditions.
This does not mean we are using history for our own ends, for the history of Europe is like a great river, into which flow manifold tributaries and streams, and the diversity of traditions and cultures which have created Europe is its great wealth.
Both can play their part in getting the most out of our various sources of protein.
Mrs Zdravkova also deserves hearty congratulations on having achieved unanimous decisions and cooperation in her first report for our committee.
Cambodia has accepted all the recommendations of the United Nations Human Rights Council in the Universal Periodic Review.
It is a vehicle for globalist power; it is preparing our economic, moral and cultural subversion.
The problems in the eurozone today are clear proof of the failure of the weak approach that we have followed over the last 10 years with the so-called open coordination method.
It is patently illegal.
(The President cut off the speaker)
The fingerprinting of children less than 14 years of age is done based on a form used in criminal investigations, which infringes the fundamental rights of the citizens.
I now have a request for Mr Daul, and will therefore continue in French.
The provision does not affect the discretion of Member States to determine which infringements are to be characterised as serious.
Thirdly, I am concerned about the food crisis that is taking shape and the effects of climate change.
The transport sector is a typical example.
Through the measures undertaken, the European Union must follow this electoral process, as you have said, but also be more ambitious in the development of relations with Iraq.
The EU should ask for explanations from the Egyptian authorities and make it clear that further violence will be followed by the cessation of European financial and humanitarian assistance.
We must discuss it with the Czechs, the Poles and the Russians.
Telling ourselves 'Let us build upon the work we have done because we just need to make some changes' is not enough.
I welcome the increased appropriations in the area of freedom, security and justice and I would stress that building a Europe of citizens also depends on proper implementation of these budget headings.
This is a crucial question that can cause serious problems, as the relevant legislation is very different in our Member States.
I should also like to stress the ineffectuality of the Spanish Members from the People's Party (PP) and the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE).
(BG) Mr. President, distinguished colleagues, the adoption and implementation of comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation in the European Union Member States is a tangible achievement and it is indicative of how sensitive a society is respecting the principles of equal treatment of all citizens, regardless of their ethnic origin, faith, gender, age, health or financial condition.
Having a Parliament determine the basis of its own composition seems to me to be fundamentally flawed.
However, climate, food and social crises are also making their impact felt just as much.
Parliament needs these powers.
However, this sensitivity is not a valid excuse to turn the European Parliament into a stage to make the most absurd of accusations, namely racism, against a national government which declares - at least this is the context of the documents we are talking about - that it is taking charge not only of public order but also of the defence of children, with reference to some nomadic communities in situations of special emergency.
He ordered that in future, all detainees held by the US must be registered with the ICRC.
in writing. - (HU) I would like to congratulate Mrs Toia on her report on the social economy that points out the key role of social economy enterprises in labour market integration, as these enterprises can greatly contribute to development and toward the realisation of social cohesion through their close connection with local communities.
I would like to thank Mrs Bastos, who was the only Portuguese MEP involved in this process.
(LT) In Europe, there has been a rapid increase in the number of elderly people whose only source of livelihood is their pension.
Impact assessments (IAs) can be of significant help from the standpoint of better law making if the economic, social, environmental and public health consequences of the intended political choices are studied throughout the political cycle, along with their impact on the public's fundamental rights.
There are restrictions on non-violent freedom of speech in almost all European Union countries.
(PL) Madam President, today the European Parliament is marking the 75th anniversary of the mass famine in Ukraine, one of the greatest crimes against humanity of the 20th century.
Whilst the intention to simplify contract law and expand cross-border trade is commendable, I nonetheless have doubts about the relevance of this approach: indeed there is a high risk that national rules, which provide maximum protection for consumers, will be bypassed.
Should we discuss this within the task force?
(Applause from the Verts/ALE Group)
The second issue - which I will not go into because it was covered by my colleague Mr Arif - is the rebalancing of rules that were set during the Uruguay Round, during the creation of the WTO, to reflect differences in terms of development, the situation of the least developed countries, the situation of developing countries.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade. - (EL) Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade, I should like to point out that the changes introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon in the area of the common commercial policy contribute overall to the enhancement of its democratic legitimacy, transparency and efficacy of the Union's external action.
The EU must urgently tackle trafficking in the labour market.
These issues therefore fall exclusively within the remit of national law, with due regard for the relevant international obligations of Greece, including the relevant conventions of the International Labour Organisation.
The debate is closed.
I personally contacted the German Federal Minister for Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection, Ilse Aigner, on 6 January, and we exchanged views on what needs to be done to avoid similar contamination and incidents in the future.
We support the measures required in connection with the regulation and transparency of the financial markets.
I would stress the need to strengthen legal instruments aimed at eliminating pay differences between women and men.
(Applause)
In my opinion, the role of the Union should be to plan the sharing out of migration pressures from the Mediterranean between the Member States, and to manage the integration of immigrants effectively.
When you return to Brussels, do what I intend to do: go and visit the Armenian restaurant.
It will have a positive employment effect and is expected to offer significant new business opportunities for EU airlines as well as benefits to the travelling public.
Member of the Commission. - For any agency, my view is that direct financing through taxpayers' money is the best way because, with its own income, you can never guarantee that public service, exactly, is delivered.
I welcome cooperation between the Member States in this area.
Why are citizens not free to decide whether they want their country's participation in EU decision-making to diminish?
If, however, security measures going above and beyond that are taken, then those Member States have to finance this themselves.
It is a pity that Italy did not draw down any of these funds.
What I can tell you is that the Member States take their own decisions on this matter.
I will relay your highly unanimous and general proposal for convening a special session of the UN Human Rights Council to the High Representative.
So that is a completely new situation.
This should not be a competence of the EU.
(HU) Mr President, security of food supply in the EU will be one of the most serious challenges facing security policy in the coming decades.
(PL) Mr President, Mrs Lichtenberger said that there are some reasonable ministers in the European Union's Member States.
In order to act fairly, we cannot compromise ourselves with double standards.
In conclusion, I would like to thank the European Parliament for its constructive contribution to the debate on the coordinated strategy to improve the fight against fiscal fraud.
In addition, Article 176 points out that the European Regional Development Fund is intended to help to redress the main regional imbalances in the Union through participation in the development and structural adjustment of regions whose development is lagging behind and in the conversion of declining industrial regions.
On a more operational level, it also includes a package of more than 50 separate measures, including four legislative proposals that translate these principles into action.
Services represent up to 40% of the gross domestic product of the Union.
Not at all: the objective is actually to provide protection for countries with average incomes which would otherwise, as you well know, fall into a system of generalised preferences.
However it is important that this report does not cause us to diverge from the main goal: further deployment of renewables and the improvement of energy efficiency.
Allow me to thank the rapporteur especially.
Second, the voting machines of a number of Romanian MEPs - expected to vote against - were curiously not working properly.
Mario Scaramella of the Mitrokhin Commission later came to London to warn Mr Litvinenko of murder threats.
My third point is financial regulation.
You are a very good orator, Mr Sarkozy, but I am not so sure that you are that good a listener.
Therefore, it is essential that we take action to improve cooperation between universities, the academic world and business.
This also means that the VAT-based own resources should be abolished and, most importantly, that there must be no EU tax, regardless of its form, while the EU is not a truly representative democracy.
They include the GPS that we are familiar with when we are driving around our towns, and can include road tax systems or road toll systems.
(CS) Madam President, I very much applaud the work of the rapporteur on regulations for improving the accessibility and quality of information on medicines for European patients.
Thirdly, we must all make an effort to communicate with the citizens.
Could the Commission state whether, from a scientific point of view, it is possible for any EU Member State to declare itself a 'GM-free zone'?
Mr President, I would particularly like to thank everyone who contributed to this success here in Parliament.
The original system for administering changes appears ineffective and unsatisfactory in view of new scientific knowledge and technological progress.
The second issue is that we need the certainty that this time, unlike in the past, the agreements will also be implemented in other territories.
I welcome the initiative from the European Commission to amend some of the financial conditions for the Structural and Cohesion Funds so that more cash can reach Member States more quickly.
So there is a huge problem there as well.
The opinion of the Council confirmed these objectives, and it is now also desirable for the Commission to take steps which will lead to the lasting sustainable development of transport, cooperation, a harmonised system of tolls and the further internalisation of external costs.
Accommodation which may be considered exceptional in one Member State may be considered average by a citizen from another Member State.
In the global world of competition and knowledge, the only way to win is to be number one, and that should be our aim.
immediate solidarity measures to meet the most basic needs of millions of human beings;
In some Member States as much as 90% of household waste ends up at landfill sites.
'He who conceals trouble only makes it worse,' warned the illustrious Hungarian poet Gyula Illyés.
In the current economic situation we cannot allow any wasteful spending or misuse of European funds.
If a worsening economic climate brings increased pressure to bear on the older workers to leave the labour market prematurely, we shall lapse into old errors.
That is quite clear.
We share their concern regarding the risk of further proliferation of the conflict.
A couple of years ago, we were told that our children would not know what snow was.
Establishing a European border management fund would be a just and significant measure in order to bring about centralised coordination, both in terms of resources and of implementing policies.
I welcome the general thrust of the intent of the banks, particularly in relation to climate control and energy, and I hope the House will support the main thrust of the report which I have brought forward.
Member of the Commission. - Both agriculture and forestry can, of course, play an important role in achieving the EU's climate objectives, and non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture are actually included in the EU's Effort Sharing Mechanism, but emissions and removals of CO2 related to land use, land-use change and forestry (what we call LULUCF) are not part of the current reduction commitment as adopted back in the 2008 in the climate and energy package.
Despite the many problems we are currently encountering, multilateral cooperation in the context of this region is far more advantageous, as it will enable cooperation within the framework of all the states associated together in Mercosur to be maintained and at the same time deepened, regardless of their economic position in the region.
The lip service paid by the European Union to religious freedom is not enough.
Sheep farming is, however, particularly important for countries with difficult geographical conditions.
I would like to share three facts with you on this matter.
I support my fellow socialists from the Committee for Workers International in the region who call for elections to a new parliament but make clear that nothing will change unless workers and the rural masses have their own candidates and independent working class party to reverse the disastrous privatisations of the last 20 years, to tackle neoliberal capitalism and to institute real democratic change and new institutions controlled by working people and with genuine planning of the economy and a Socialist Federation of Central Asia.
Now is not the time for the status quo, or routine.
This promising future is why we must move swiftly on a comprehensive settlement, with action on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks.
Oral explanations of vote
A new Europe is not a Europe where each one decides what they want and how they want it.
The European Arrest Warrant is a gross miscarriage of justice in itself.
In this respect, the Commission is identifying clear criteria to apply before further contributions to the Global Fund can be resumed.
The topic is WikiLeaks and cyber security.
The consensus defines these principles for action, on which our institution's humanitarian action is based.
Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of 20 December 2006, established the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) with the aim of supporting workers who lose their jobs due to structural changes in the context of the global economy.
I voted against the majority resolution because it failed to stipulate the improvement of environmental performance as a precondition for receiving public money.
Its place in Article 1, which concerns the scope and the objectives, makes this proposal in essence a principle that applies to all the directives in the package, particularly where access and services are concerned.
I therefore voted in favour.
To this end, it is important that entrepreneurs in Ireland are fully informed on how to make best use of the Small Business Act.
Amid the general silence, in mid-2003, the manufacturer, thinking that this silence meant that the German authorities' unexplained comments had clearly been refuted, placed the product back on the market.
The basis of the report, as it emerged from the work of the Human Rights Subcommittee, is reasonably good, and it has some elements that I believe are essential.
Member States in South-Eastern Europe are faced with huge deficits.
Member States retain their power to set these admission criteria and the number of migrants they wish to admit to their own country with a view to taking up employment.
(Applause)
rapporteur. - Mr President, my recommendation is to vote against postponement as conditions for postponement have not been met by the Council.
History teaches us that armed conflicts are an outcome of the inability of the combatants to talk about contentious issues and find compromise solutions.
As far as this goes, this is a right and sensible path to take.
This measure will reduce child abuse by organised criminals across borders, which is another reason why I support this apparently controversial topic.
Are there any proposals from the Council with regard to putting together a team of facilitators to allow the different traditions in Bosnia-Herzegovina to come together to agree a common standard or common code for how the police force should work?
In 2007 the Council reached political agreement on a framework decision which aims to ensure that each Member State can respond as fully and correctly as possible to requests for criminal records made to them on their nationals.
A land border can be closed relatively easily, but a sea border cannot.
Liberalisation and international trade deregulation policies are a central tenet of this policy framework, and are contributing decisively to the current situation.
In November 2005, MEPs and Member States adopted the Mining Waste Directive.
However, because of the considerable differences in gas and energy markets I would be in favour of the rapporteur's proposal that these sectors be regulated separately.
The current situation in Yemen and the terrible suffering to which its people are being subjected should be analysed in the light of this situation.
It is what the electorate of Europe now expects, and will enable us to act together with strength.
Just imagine!
Projects relating to the continuing growth of cooperation between Member States in the field of education, exchanges of good practice, as also the Europe of Knowledge and Innovation, are all supported both by the Polish government and the EU authorities.
As stated in the resolution, the Commission and the Member States must make every effort to ensure that a proper portion of the money available for health care reaches poor people in developing countries and every effort must be made to ensure that health care services in poor areas are improved and supported.
Our problem is that we also encounter enormous levels of prejudice in our societies - and I mean now in those Member States where the problems with Roma are perhaps worse than in other Member States.
Apparently, they have fewer cars in these countries, so maybe that percentage is lower.
The single telephone number that Henry Kissinger allegedly demanded is brought up again and again.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, I very much welcome the Commissioner's statement and in particular the tone in which he opened it when he was referring to patients as being the centre of this.
At the same time, however, we seldom stand up for the rights of Christians in those very same countries, in the countries where possessing a Bible is often punished by many years in prison, and on many occasions even death, in countries where it would not just be hard to build a Christian place of worship, it would be simply impossible.
Pending wider solutions, it is essential that we can count on solid arrangements between us when we are deployed together in the same theatre.
Does it know what voodoo rites are?
Particularly adverse phenomena are to be seen in rural areas, where the number of young people wanting to take over the running of farms continues to fall.
That would be a recipe for communal strife in the future.
In today's vote, we saw support for the report concerning innovative financing in the world and in Europe.
Action taken on Parliament's positions and resolutions: see Minutes
This situation must improve.
(PL) I would like to go back to Questions Nos 7 and 8, and to relations between the European Union and Russia.
The clause contains proposals for additional measures.
I also wish to warmly thank the rapporteur, Carlos Coelho, for his remarkable report and also for the excellent cooperation maintained with the Commission on a delicate and sensitive issue.
However, some sort of cooperation between the Commission and Member States would be desirable to ensure good practices and strategies capable of guaranteeing the utmost transparency and to prevent possible illegal and casual adoptions, but also to ensure the maximum level of cooperation from Member States in guaranteeing the right of adoption and preventing children from being abandoned to themselves or, as I said before, abandoned to an institution.
The rather contemptuous satisfaction shown here regarding the 'yes' extracted from the Irish after months of harassment, guilt campaigns, lies and half-truths is a disgrace to democracy and an insult to the will of the people.
I believe there are huge possibilities for dialogue, but not just on human rights and not just on the all-important nuclear issue.
It looks as if the issue of climate change is not what is important here, just business issues.
The directive presses all the right buttons and goes some way towards addressing the problem.
We can only condemn the use of force and violence by the police and the KGB against protesters on election day.
This weekend, I heard a talk from a leading Scottish psychiatrist and also someone from Barnardo's.
Thanks to this report, we are presented with a different image of culture.
I am anxious about the wording of some of the compromises.
In recent years, the Italian Government has tried everything possible to resolve the long-standing issue of the waste collection and disposal system.
I would therefore suggest that an inquiry be carried out and that you and we sit down to determine the research question, that we have an enquiry carried out and that we then discuss this at length.
2007 was the first year - as various fellow Members pointed out - in which the Member States were asked to draft an annual summary of the available inspections and statements, but, according to the Court of Auditors, it does not work.
We agreed to discuss nuclear issues and we accepted that these are a subject to be debated between us, because it was made clear from the beginning that no subject was taboo.
However, this compromise represents a balance between the environmental requirements and the quality-related economic constraints.
These include illegal removal of tags, smuggling of cattle across borders from foot-and-mouth-affected areas, and the proper testing of cattle.
We believe in equality for all people in Europe.
This support force could be located in high-risk countries and be ready for action from the summer of 2008.
Farmers should be able to focus on their primary responsibility: producing high quality products.
We have made significant progress on the issue of direct payments, emphasising that it is essential to define appropriate minimum and maximum support levels, expressed as a percentage of the EU average, which farmers of every Member State may receive.
We want the internal market to be effective, dynamic and innovative.
Thank you.
The dissemination of these will therefore be much more detailed than last year.
I therefore fully understand the questions that have been submitted and I call on the European Commission and the Council to resolve the situation quickly.
Romania has made major financial and human efforts.
Clearly, the 2008 war and the inhumane policy towards civilians are intended to be forgotten.
Therefore start by listening to the public when they say 'no' or when they tell you to call a halt.
A child's right to grow up in a healthy family environment which is beneficial to its harmonious development is the key concept behind this resolution.
I did not vote against the report as, this way, the Commissioner for Energy, Mr Oettinger, has a chance to stand by his original proposal and ban the exporting of radioactive materials to third countries.
Now we must use these relations, through you, Mr President, and through every delegation that goes there, every parliamentary committee or delegation such as mine, which maintains relations with China.

I am proud that the Lisbon Treaty incorporates the essential elements of the Constitution that we drew up, which was endorsed by the majority of countries at the time, but as the co-rapporteur Mr Méndez de Vigo said, I would also like to say that this is not the end of the road, it is not the end of the story.

However, what may be even more serious is the use of cluster munitions.
Now that ground forces have been attacked, I think that there is good reason to question whether this nofly zone was created for that.
This is a key building-block in restoring confidence, and this is why the Commission will continue to adopt the proposals as set out in its communication of 4 March 2009 on hedge funds and private equity, on executive pay and on how to follow up on the ideas set out in the report of the high-level group I have established under the leadership of Mr de Larosière.

Amendment 81, which is the corresponding amendment to the article, is not marked as falling when the corresponding article amendment, 55, is passed.
I do think, however, that these actions should be implemented by each Member State, in the first instance.
Documents received: see Minutes
Specifically regarding the economic crisis, on which we had a debate yesterday and you were nodding in agreement: we have huge concerns about institutional care of children and young adults, and I worry that the economic crisis - and perhaps you share this - will slow the process of de-institutionalisation, and that this is an issue we need to be very careful of, both within and outside the EU.
However, in view of Turkey's recent decision and the blatant threat of a military incursion which violates the territorial integrity of Iraq, I do wonder which aims Turkey is actually pursuing.

Poverty is a dangerous phenomenon, particularly among children, because, in many cases, it is hereditary.
The reason for this is that some Members, including Mr Davies, inform me that Hamas recognises Israel, but not the State of Israel.
These murders known as feminicides are caused by a social context influenced by a patriarch mindset that prevents women from becoming socially independent.
I am a little concerned, and the rapporteur points to it in her explanatory statement, that in 2002, we were also full of good intentions but that reform failed the fishing sector and failed the sustainability criteria as well.
We also need to strengthen its efficiency by looking into how we can convince Member States to honour the promises they made when they committed themselves to providing equipment for FRONTEX missions.
The third proposal in the package tightens the rules intended to prevent counterfeit medicines from being placed on the market.
Is it not the case that these laws are, as I believe, too reliant on the credit ratings of credit rating agencies?

Just last week I was present in the Netherlands at the launch of the first EU-supported microfinance facility and there are more in the pipeline in order to support potential entrepreneurs, perhaps after the experience of being unemployed: women coming back to the labour market after childbirth or people who have already been working and want to seek a new form of enterprise beyond 50, or even 60.

Let us also make another point, that none of the Commissioners are actually elected by the people.

Do the Chinese authorities seriously think (...)
We all agree with the 'polluter pays' principle, but then when we go into the practical applications, differences emerge between Member States, between political forces, between MEPs, between the Commission, Parliament and Council.

The European Council has approved the European economic recovery plan, worth EUR 200 billion.
The press and radio stations on the other side of the Iron Curtain named those imprisoned, which allowed us to hope we would be safe.

Madam President, honourable Member, as you know, one of the Union's priorities or strategic central objectives is energy security.
Before closing I would like to stress that today's debate will provide an important contribution to the preparation of the CFP reform, but it will also send an important political signal - a positive signal - to the men and women of the European fisheries sector, who are prepared for tougher discipline but are also expecting a message of hope for their future.

Address by the President of Parliament
It has great success in this work, as is widely recognised.
In some countries, like my country, Romania, this amounts to 50% of all deaths.
However, the preparatory phase of the legislation made it clear that the biocides sector is not very harmonised and neither the Commission nor the Member States have sufficient experience or knowledge to propose specific measures on biocides, therefore the decision was not to include this category of products in the initial proposal that has been presented for your consideration.

I therefore hope that certain MEPs from the right, including, surprisingly, some Hungarian MEPs, will not succeed in their endeavour to prevent the creation of a Directive to protect the interests of Hungarian agriculture and the environment.

Lastly, to prevent us from falling into some rather typically European romantic temptations with respect to terrorism or organisations which, like the FARC, are now drug-dealing guerrillas, not the romantic paramilitary groups of the 70s, they could also be called upon to abandon violence once and for all, unilaterally and unconditionally.
The sheer number of them clearly demonstrates the level of interest in this issue.
The second reason why I have recommended that we do not vote in favour is because with regard to the free trade area, regional differences are not taken into account.

We will not make any progress in our Neighbourhood Policy unless we change our views and develop new political approaches.

(Applause)
We have all been waiting a long time for it.

Take this also as proof of our confidence in you that we expect you to be very clear in what you say.
Madam President, I think that Mr Leinen put his finger on it.
The role of the EU should be concentrated more on medium- and long-term aid and aimed at the reconstruction of Haitian towns and villages, of their infrastructure, schools and hospitals.

I am very unhappy about the way that we have been arguing about PNR for five years now, and the Council and the Commission just charge ahead like a runaway train.

It will therefore be essential for us to avoid such controversial errors when formulating these agreements in the future, and I hope that the Commission will manage that, as we definitely cannot consider the current document to be satisfactory, particularly in the area of personal data protection.
The Committee on Transport and Tourism has therefore decided to table this own-initiative report with the aim of setting out some general principles regarding how air agreements should be evaluated in terms of substance, and of the procedures the committee might adopt in order to remain well informed throughout the course of negotiations and so that it has an opportunity to express its priorities well before being confronted with the final decision and merely being able to adopt or reject it.
Therefore, I also agree that transnational sites should be held in particular consideration, in virtue of their symbolic importance.
When determining the final quota reductions, therefore, I am in favour of taking into account the scale of production in each Member State.

The second aspect that I consider to be a priority, at this time of economic crisis, when we still cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel, is the relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy.
This would be a flagrant breach of citizens' rights, freedoms and guarantees.
And here I should like to turn to Mr Martin's comment.

Two years and two months ago, as we adopted the guidelines on employment policy in the Member States we emphasised the need to remove all obstacles to the free movement of workers in Europe as envisaged by the Treaties.

It needs to become part of the European agenda.
We have a new opportunity this year to develop the relationship further.

The challenges we face must not be underestimated.
I am pleased to see that many amendments fully support the objectives of the Commission's proposals on the directive on waste electronic and electrical equipment, namely: to fully reap the environmental benefits of the WEEE Directive by setting ambitious collection and recovery targets that are realistic for all the Member States; to strengthen implementation and enforcement by establishing detailed rules to fight illegal exports of EU waste; and to reduce unnecessary administrative burdens significantly for European producers through reinforced cooperation among national authorities.
I would like to finish with two remarks.
The right way to save energy involves educating the citizens of Europe and establishing tax incentive systems.
They must make much more efficient and more consistent use of RAPEX.
In addition, opportunities for treatment will be created, especially for wealthy patients, and at the same time access to healthcare will be obstructed, especially for patients in poor Member States.

The Council looks favourably on the possibility of providing Community financial support for the activities of these foundations under very clear rules which will allow, among other aspects, a clear distinction to be made between the areas of intervention of the parties which must be complementary and not overlapping.
Therefore, we require a real mechanism for evaluating Schengen.
What we political groups are not open to, I believe, is putting up with the demagogy of certain people who make it their way of conducting politics.

It is often maintained that, as a result, we could also make energy cheaper.
We also suggest not focusing exclusively on the situation of countries in debt but balancing it with an assessment of countries in surplus.

One aspect of this is to increase the effectiveness of supervision and control mechanisms for antibiotics in animals, as I mentioned in the debate held here less than a month ago.

Mr Barroso, I think it makes a good deal of sense for you to ask yourself what the economic and social solutions might be to the problems we have at the moment and the crisis we are experiencing, not taking advantage of the Commission's services but as leader of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats; I think this is of great importance so that we do not find ourselves in a situation in which the European Council wants Parliament merely to be consulted (let us recall the Buttiglioni case).
Presentation of the Commission work programme for 2011 (motions for resolutions tabled): see Minutes
Here we have another European year, this time against extreme poverty.
Our first objective should be to consolidate managing institutions and reduce management expenditure.

Therefore, we will always, and in every country, condemn the perpetration of violence and the murder of innocent people, especially now, when it involves our ally and friend.
This is a matter of principle that is all the more important in the context of the unbridled liberalisation of transportation promoted by the EU.
The assessment should therefore be carried out across the board, with account taken of the whole economic environment that surrounds very small enterprises, their relations with banks, with management centres - in the case of French enterprises - and, of course, with their customers.

In my opinion, this is a promising sign for further progress in this exceptionally sensitive area.
I do not see this coming from the European Council and it is time it did.
I think that religion, talking and learning about the standards and values we all prize so greatly in Europe, is extremely important.
In the Financial Perspective 2007-2013, the European Agriculture Fund for Rural Development was made the second pillar of the CAP and was thereby separated from cohesion policy.
I shall say a few words on Cyprus.
I would like to draw attention to the fact that although the Commission planned to create new jobs and implement the objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy as soon as possible, in the field of employment and social affairs there are no specific proposals on the creation of new and high quality jobs in the Commission's programme for the coming year.
I hope that you, ladies and gentlemen, will support this regulation which, above all, will help to protect the people in those countries which are affected.
However, you can say what you like on paper, but actions speak louder than words.

The reactions to your proposal for economic governance indicate that this is exactly where the problem lies.
If you are now telling us to wait for better times and if you agree with Jean-Claude Juncker, who said yesterday that we have done enough, then I say: you have not done enough - people expect more from Europe than you are saying today.
The Council recommendation of 12 July 1999 on the limitation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields establishes a framework of minimum restrictions and reference levels, but the Member States are responsible for the implementation of the measures.

It includes 10 very different countries, but this diversity, despite making the negotiations for a free trade agreement more complicated, should not prevent us from achieving instruments that will provide mutual benefits and complement the WTO multilateral system, including from the point of view of a satisfactory conclusion to the Doha Development Agenda, that both parties consider to be a priority.

For this reason I expect the Czech presidency to take fresh steps towards securing financial support for the Nabucco gas pipeline and a more vigorous energy policy in Central Asia.
The economic crisis has had a drastic impact on global trade.
Two years ago, the European Investment Bank responded rapidly and efficiently to the unfolding global financial and economic crisis by strengthening its lending activities, primarily by increasing loans provided to small and medium-sized enterprises, and on the other hand by participating with all the capacity available to it in the implementation of the European Union's Economic Recovery Plan.
rapporteur. - Mr President, I would like to thank the Commission.
This is sometimes vital to their survival.
That is why the joint resolution no longer contains the quotation.
What I am interested in today is what you intend to do.

I voted for this report and I congratulate the rapporteur.
I intended, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, to request a statement from the Council and Commission on the Black Sea disaster. Without hearing who was in favour and who was against, I am not sure what was decided.
This action must be taken in an open market, however, not by creating additional obstacles in a market in which there are already hundreds.
I support the position that current economic austerity and the provisions of the Lisbon Treaty may help Member States towards smarter spending on defence by pooling and sharing a larger proportion of their defence capabilities, budget and requirements, while achieving more security for their citizens, although the reality is that the economic and financial crisis affects EU national defence budgets, programmes and force structures and, therefore, more than one year after the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, there are not yet clear signs of a post-Lisbon EU holistic approach enabling traditional procedural and institutional barriers to be overcome.
In the field of regional development, there is an increase of about 3.2%, which is considered essential.
EU biofuels policy does not reduce the availability of food, as the quantities of feedstocks used are very small on a global scale.

That means a minimum of four times a year, though in most years, that is more likely to be five or six and may, in the future, rise to 10.

On this point, I should like to say the following to those that might not have read my statement: on 21 January, I delivered a very clear position statement on the situation in Gaza, because I, too, realised that things had simply gone too far.
At the informal January session the Council debated asylum issues and practical cooperation among the Member States.
Perhaps I might expand on this by saying that our citizens also have a right to know how the European Union spends its taxes and where resources are wasted.
The second issue specific to Romania is the continuation, obviously on a much smaller scale, of transhumance, a practice which should be treated, in my view, as a separate issue in itself and preserved as far as possible.

The agreement we have reached may not be the best solution, but it does provide the opportunity for further progress to be made in the future.

Particularly with a view to preserving its - our - credibility, the European Union must finally start taking the democracy and human rights clauses in its agreements with third countries seriously and taking the appropriate action - ideally positive but, if necessary, negative.
I am not being critical in saying this; I am describing the reality of the situation.
I would, of course, also like to urge the Council to pass on all of the information relating to this matter to the European Parliament.
We need to quickly find the funds from which to make the resources available and get help to those affected without delay.

(The vote on the Andersson report is postponed until 22 October 2008)
Developing new applications and the very operation of the 'Internet of Things', along with the massive impact this will have on the everyday life and habits of the European public, is very closely linked to the confidence that European customers have in the system.

Attracting and making the best use of these funds would have resulted in a 15% rise in GDP over the next five years.

Calls have been made for more to be done and for more resources to be provided for research and infrastructure.
(FR) Mr President, since there are not very many of us here, I too will take advantage of the opportunity to add, in the same spirit as Mr Morillon, that people actually expect a great deal from Europe and even today - as Mr von Wogau knows - Georgia, a country which is covered by our neighbourhood policy, is almost on the brink of war.
I also support the fact that access to classified information or documents, in particular to sensitive documents, should be subject to observance by the Ombudsman of rules strictly equivalent to those in force in the institution or body in question.

I think that the message this Parliament will give today by voting through these new measures is that we want goods to move freely, we want to increase competition and consumer choice, but we will not compromise on safety and, therefore, we have stepped up enforcement surveillance and given the CE mark the legal protection it deserves, to ensure that importers and manufacturers can be legally prosecuted if they fail in their duty of responsibility to protect the consumer.
Quite rightly, the structural funds, the rural development funds and the instruments for pre-accession were underlined as being important levers for change because they allow Member States to implement ambitious programmes which are targeted to the Roma.
It is a realistic report and, most importantly, it is a report which forms a very good basis for the opening of talks.
This is to be done, as you said yourself, in order to prevent a race amongst the Member States to enact protectionism.
Dip into the flexibility instrument?
We have long complained that there are too many complaints being made to that office which do not relate to its function.
In other words, as he has been re-elected once for his prudence, I would like to re-elect him for a third term for his courage.

It is an investment in the future and in much healthier societies.
In the Netherlands, for example, they perform some social care services.
Despite concerns from some Members, I believe that we need to foster closer cooperation with these countries as this allows the EU to monitor catches of tuna and other fish that are canned on Papua New Guinea.
Before we start promoting these cultures outside Europe, even we ourselves have to want to become familiarised with all those cultural elements which are typical of Europe.
It is quite obvious that, if we expect people to be more flexible, we have to make sure that they are not punished for this by the loss of the social safety net.

Member of the Commission. - Firstly I would like to thank the honourable Member for helping me move ahead in this policy.

In connection with the decision in this regard, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament voted against Amendments 16, 17 and 19, because, despite having a favourable content, these amendments were not relevant to the discussion in question.
Even the rapporteur admits this.
Where had they come from?
For the non-euro area new Member States, the leeway for using the budget stimulus out of their own resources is much reduced because of this financial crisis, and the credit crunch is likely to prevail on the international markets in 2009.
This goes for the whole debate on legislation and regulation and ambitious targets.
In deliberately losing their papers or refusing to say where they come from, so as not to be returned to their country of origin, illegal immigrants and they alone are responsible for the period they spend in detention, which some believe, wrongly, is too long.

The Commission should urgently propose the measures required to scale up EU financial support for climate change and development, ensuring the best possible coordination and complementarity with existing initiatives.
However, if I hear this type of reaction from the Commission, I will seriously reconsider and suggest to my group that we reconsider whether we can support the SPE product.

I would like to draw attention to the fact that while using new technical measures, which are aimed at achieving a high level of airport security, it is also very important to set boundaries between human rights and security itself, as those measures are not only related to the protection of citizens, but to the impact on their rights and freedoms.

I would also like to thank you, in particular, for the changes in policy that you have brought about, namely greater consideration of the Lisbon objectives, the greening of our activities, and an emphasis on R&D, and today I have once again observed that you also specifically referred to cultural heritage as something with an economic and cultural value.

This is a question not so much of policy but of fundamental morals and ethics.
To conclude, I would like to say that what we will be doing tomorrow and what we did last November will be important for all of us, for the strengthening of economic and political cooperation, not only in the region, but in the European Union as well.

Energy security can only be achieved through a cohesive, effective and above all common policy.
We ought to encourage research and eco-innovation through the development of energy-efficient technologies, without, however, ignoring the need for a shift in our consumer habits.

I would like, in this Chamber, to express approval for the Greek Government.
From my perspective, this whole programme is a huge disappointment.
The Union does not use just one or several languages of its own choosing, which the majority of its citizens might not understand.

Furthermore, I should also like to say that numerous initiatives have been taken by the Member States, mainly through their parliaments, with investigations being conducted in line with the recommendations made by the European Parliament's report.
When the parliamentary term began, we finally saw nations join us that for many decades had been deprived of their freedom, and the accession of Romania and Bulgaria during the parliamentary term has reinforced the world's image of a Europe that is able to create unity by respecting differences.
This includes contacts, for instance, regarding the trans-Caspian gas pipeline, Nabucco.

I advocate measures to mitigate the impact of the economic crisis on the health sector by investing in infrastructure.

Europe must show leadership, but leadership means not only taking the lead, but also persuading others, winning them over - and this in the extremely competitive environment of international aviation.

For the long term, we have, in principle, the Food Security Thematic Programme under the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI).

This has meant that many homes have seen their incomes fall, and many are exposed to poverty and excessive debt.
This is the other meaning of diversity.
The important thing to do in the meantime, of course, is to limit the damage, but that is not what this report is trying to achieve: the new application procedure actually makes it easier, not tougher, for people to enter the European Union.
The next item is the joint debate on the following:
More efficient energy use is one of the most effective ways of reducing the amount of gas emissions which cause the greenhouse effect and of ensuring that the great EU climate policy plans are implemented.

The Commission is happy to endorse all the compromise amendments tabled by the rapporteur.
We are busy adopting regulations here in Parliament while the Member States are doing what they want.
It is therefore very important to create the necessary conditions for the holding of elections, within a time frame which gives all opposition forces and all the media time to organise at national level, for a new parliamentary assembly with the task of drawing up a democratic constitution which strikes a proper balance between the powers of the executive and the legislature and the independence of the judiciary.
This proposal destroys people's lives and their communities in remote regions.
None the less, it is an encouraging signal for the internal market as well as for the small and medium-sized enterprises that operate in the internal market.

I have mentioned just a few names, but many of you could speak on this issue, the issue of milk quotas.
It is completely paradoxical that we are not reacting to Pakistan's nuclear weapons, which do actually exist, in a particularly unstable geopolitical context, or those of North Korea, in the hands of a particularly dangerous regime.

rapporteur. - Madam President, this energy package is the culmination of years of hard work in which Parliament can be very proud of the changes that will now be put in place.
What was so objectionable to the committee?
I probably do not need to tell all honourable Members that, simply within the rules of the World Trade Organisation, if countries moved from applying their tariffs the way that they do at the present time to applying them in the way they are allowed to do under the rules, then the cost to trade would be something of the order of EUR 260 billion.
We will have many ideas on this subject.
We have tried to do everything so that sooner rather than later all the neighbourhood countries - depending on their ability and also on mutual interests - will become associated countries.

(RO) Mr President, I welcome the Commission's decision to impose stress tests on the European Union's nuclear reactors.
Once again this has shown the benefits of the European Union's common monetary policy for both the European economy and individual citizens in periods of instability.
I voted for this report, but I am giving this explanation of vote to stress that, in paragraph 44 on the management of the market, I voted against the first part of the paragraph proposed by the rapporteur and for the second part of it, which finally sets Parliament's decision out as favourable to Portugal's strategic interests.
(SV) Mr President, tomorrow, we will vote on whether to allow Bulgaria and Romania to join the Schengen area.
In a way that is good: the Lisbon Strategy is designed to run counter to the construction of a socialist Europe.

What this means is that, in Frontex, we have an institution that physically seals off Europe and organises deportations, and does so regardless of the UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.
Unfortunately, that went against the principles of the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline.
We regularly speak about a global approach.
Despite this, while recognising the efforts of the Portuguese Presidency, I would like to ask whether the text of the statement can be further improved, particularly in the section referring to poor developing countries.
Once again, Europe has appeared divided on such a vital issue and has repeated the mistakes of the past.
This economic crisis is here.

It is not enough to voice our concerns; it is time to apply the principle of conditionality and to declare, as our colleague, Mr Watson, told us: a deal is a deal.
The establishment of an International Day of the Heroes of the Fight Against Totalitarianism would be a step in the direction of a common understanding of 20th-century European history and part of the common fight against mutual prejudice and ignorance concerning historical facts.
The second is respect for the rule of law, and consequently for a number of fundamental principles: the transparency of procedures, the possibility of taking legal action and the right to defence.
I advocate these fundamental principles being made mandatory in every Member State and believe that a system of sanctions should be introduced for non-compliance.

Subject: Interinstitutional agreement on 'Communicating Europe in Partnership'

Fear of attacks by the PKK, anger that could lead to escalation.
We do not like how the debate has been going so far.
We are radically opposed to the liberalisation of the market in the dairy sector.
If you start with incorrect assumptions, in other words, that disputing the first instance in detail will save costs in subsequent instances, it will automatically seem as if all Member States have poor first-instance procedures.
In the wake of the failed climate change negotiations at Copenhagen, I am keen to hear how the Presidency will work with the Commission to put forward a common EU target for emissions reductions for the 31 January target.
Another sticking point with the PPE-DE Group, ladies and gentlemen, is the decision of the Committee on the Environment to extend the scope of the regulation from pesticide sales and use to pesticide production, import, export and distribution.

It is particularly important that we take advantage of your privileged insight into what is really happening on the ground.
This will have to be unravelled.
It is hardly surprising, consequently, that the German Government continues to oppose CO2 limits on vehicles, that it is not in favour of the single market for energy as proposed by the Commission and that it is attempting to organise an alliance against the 'new definitions of emissions trading'.
I am very pleased that the final wording of Article 2 of the regulation faithfully repeats the wording of Article 11(4) of the Treaty itself.
The involvement of foreign banks in the Ukrainian banking sector has already reached 35%.
Nevertheless, the political debates, the conservative attacks on human rights are alarming and they clearly underline the fact that the fight for women's rights is far from over.

We stress the need to establish a link between this and the European Union's Danube strategy.
Concerning the point that was made on positive incentives, I agree that these are important, but we need to find the right mix and the right levels, because otherwise they could be counterproductive, and we could end up with a situation whereby we encourage more catches when, for sustainability reasons, we would want to reduce them in order to reach MSY levels.

2.
This absurd situation must be stopped and I believe that the European Commission and European Parliament need to seek solutions to this.
Mr Verheugen, in the first debate we discussed the draft of Mr Kuhne's report with Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner.
We hope that a majority of this House will support this call for reason to prevail in the vote on Wednesday.
In this case it is clear that the Commission's line involves unjustified bureaucracy.
I was somewhat surprised by this because a candidate country should also be bringing its visa policy closer to that of the European Union, not moving in the opposite direction.
However, we need to table a proposed amendment to this directive in order to guarantee an overall unity of intent within Europe and also greater protection for laboratory guinea pigs used for scientific purposes connected with human and animal health.

I am really looking forward to the successful establishment of the EIT and once again I would like to express my deep gratitude for Parliament's commitment and contribution.

Documents received: see Minutes
But if he is interested in having a real debate here, then I would be pleased if he would support our Group's request to hold a debate on this subject in this House at the earliest opportunity.
Mr President, I too supported the Morgan report because I am convinced that we should be unbundling ownership fully in this particular sector, and the experience of Member States indicates that full ownership unbundling leads to increased investment and improved network performance.
I think that measures are required to facilitate workers' mobility in this sector without unjustified barriers and restrictions.
Something of a split might be discerned in the Court of Auditors' report: the slightly more correct northern net contributors as opposed to the southern beneficiaries that are rather more prone to abuse.

I also believe that today's debate will spur the Member States on which have not yet ratified the Convention and/or Optional Protocol to do so in the foreseeable future.
This is why I do not feel able to support what are almost one-sided inflexible attitudes to one country or another, but I do strongly support the need for enhanced monitoring of all of the problematic situations, in the spirit of the legislation in force and according to the principles of the rules on which we want to base the legislative review that we are demanding.

We must not forget that pensioners represent a 'captive' social group.

(RO) As part of this debate, I would like to make a comment stating that national minorities make a great deal of fuss because they do not have arguments to support all the rights which they claim.
We welcome the fact that, despite the seriousness of the events, dialogue between the parties has so far been maintained and fresh rounds of negotiations are planned.
In my view, he enjoys a presumption of innocence.
One source of these successes is in fact reforms, and here thanks and recognition are due, both to Mikuláš Dzurinda's government, which brought in these difficult reforms, and to Robert Fico's current government, which is continuing them.
Are you going to reach a conclusion in June?
Minister and President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with most of the previous speakers that the Copenhagen Summit is probably the most important summit of the entire year for the European Union and also for the whole world.
The compromise was 250 km.
We do not feel that Member States are showing much commitment and, therefore, we will not be supporting this proposal.
After the conflict between Russia and Georgia had unleashed in August last year, one might have felt inclined to think that good fences make good neighbours.
In the words of the commander of the Russian navy, this type of ship would have enabled the Russian navy, in August 2008, to carry out its mission in 40 minutes instead of 26 hours.
The SWIFT agreement is a kind of democratic test that we are all duty-bound to pass for the good of our fellow citizens.
Both partners should agree on a common approach to containing climate change.
We should find a way for negotiations to be very fair to everyone and not at the expense of the European agriculture sector.
The role of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly should be further consolidated and its work better articulated with the other bodies of the partnership.
I am very honoured to be leading Parliament's delegation to the Human Rights Council's 16th session at this critical time next week.
Use of such data for other purposes, such as law enforcement, is neither legitimate nor proportional.
A terse reference to formal proceedings in the case of a Member State which has not yet transposed an EU law at the national level does not tell us or our citizens very much.
So it is time the negotiations were suspended.
These policies will fail to reduce the deficits in Greece, in Spain and elsewhere, because the expected tax revenue will fail to materialise also.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis in the motor industry has spread throughout the entire sector, to ancillary industries, other associated sectors, commercial networks and thus services, and has terrible prospects in terms of employment.
An auction simply takes pollution away from Europe, dumps it somewhere else, and brings us unemployment.
I do think, however, that in these circumstances it would be worth considering the use of a more radical approach, for example, using UN special forces to take the accused to the ICC, and then imprisoning those found guilty and interning them for life, with no right of return, on some distant island with some telling name such as Evildoers' Island.
Therefore, I must stick to the present system until it is changed, but we will be ready to consider all new guidelines and study them extremely carefully.
The Commission has concluded the negotiations on an agreement to facilitate a visa waiver and ensure readmission, the text for which is available in the Council.
Indeed, Member States will only have the possibility, but in no way will they be obliged, of making heavy goods vehicles pay for the external costs they cause.
The proposal by the European Commission and this report are thus essential elements in the implementation of sustainable, responsible fishing that enables European fishermen to earn a living.
In spite of this, it seems that when choice suddenly appears in the form of a wide range of goods and products, then there is an increase in the proportion of people in society who care about food quality, product quality, water quality and air quality.
We have not yet reached that point.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the October session of the European Council will be a key moment and it will show whether or not Europe is aware of the urgent need to act on the economy, on social questions and to overcome institutional quarrels.
Finally, we must bear in mind that an effective information policy at EU level must be conducted in order to increase our citizens' awareness of this subject.
(PL) Mr President, it is most regrettable that we find ourselves debating Mauritania today.
We cannot fail to react to the brutal action which has been seen in Guinea.
I would like to say that it is now difficult to understand whose project it is.
But secondly - and they are linked - there are real concerns about the selling-out on agriculture in the European Union.
I am therefore also pleased to announce that the Commission will prepare, before the European Council in June, an analysis of which practical policies would be required to implement a 30% emission reduction by 2020.
But I am afraid some of the amendments to which the Commission has already made reference take away from the spirit of our initial intentions and the initial way in which we reacted.
Thank you for this debate.
In this regard, we need to promote existing cultural programmes and support new initiatives such as the creation of a European heritage label, which will help to develop a common identity while encouraging cultural tourism.
The geostrategic and economic importance of the rapidly developing Black Sea region is undeniable.
We do not understand how substances such as lead, mercury or cadmium can still be found in toys.

Madam President, it is with great regret that I am addressing the House as a Member from a country that has not yet opted into the Schengen Agreement.
It is estimated that signing the agreement would cause losses ranging from several billion euro to several times this amount.
This is shown, in particular, by the statements made by Members of this House on homosexuals, for example.
However, we are sorry that the Council has still not approved the framework decision on the definition of data protection in order to lay down certain minimum rules.
Mr Mugabe has proved beyond any reasonable doubt that he is totally unfit to govern his country in the modern world.

It is obvious that by harmonising regulations, reducing bureaucratic burdens and restricting costs, we have the chance for a simpler, fairer and more understandable common agricultural policy.
In the battle for access to raw materials, however, Western value-based policy draws the shorter straw increasingly frequently.
(ES) Mr President, I would like to mention the challenges we must face and overcome in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, namely, establishing a proper, joint migration and asylum policy; effective control of our external borders; an effective integration and repatriation policy, a Eurojust that is credible and trustworthy; a Europol to serve the Community, under the control of the European Parliament; progress in terms of harmonising the field of civil and criminal justice; effective transatlantic relations, especially with the United States, based on trust and equality; an equitable solution to the issue of SWIFT data; an effective data protection policy; better protection for the euro against counterfeiting and active promotion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
South Korea - death penalty declared legal

If we placed a heavy burden on European industry, which has to compete in the global marketplace, what would happen is that some of our industry would move away from Europe.
(BG) President, Commissioner, colleagues, I find the report very important and very necessary.
Above all, the most important issue seems to me to be for us to have totally consistent legislation and the problem with the 1 000 metres is that it does not make any sense to say that one cannot fish below 1 000 metres outside European waters, and yet one can fish below 1 000 metres in European waters - this does not make any sense from the point of view of the legislation's environmental soundness.
Throughout this report, Parliament shows itself to be proactive by supporting new forms of financing which need to be introduced more generally.
Finally, it is important to stress that regional planning has so far been largely land-based and has failed to take into account the impact of coastal development on certain maritime activities.
Naturally, this is not a frequent occurrence but, when it does happen, it understandably and justifiably causes great antipathy in Hungarian public opinion.

I could not say that we have noticed any substantial changes, although we are aware of the potential for change, and the potential for a new chapter in the relationship between the European Union and Cuba.
However, the EUR 60 million allocated to the Global Climate Change Alliance is wholly insufficient and therefore it is important for the Commission to set out long-term funding and allocate at least EUR 2 billion until 2010, and EUR 5 billion until 2020.
My decision to vote for the establishment of a financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised countries, which was adopted by an overwhelming majority in this House, fully supports the common line of applying Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

The Baltic Sea Strategy must therefore be made part of the common European agenda.
Debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law (announcement of motions for resolutions tabled): see Minutes
Let us await its report, and only then will we decide on further action.
Mexico offers exceptional tourism potential, has magnificent historical cultural treasures and is also a favourite destination of many Europeans.
I agree with the opinion expressed in the resolution that this initiative is an appropriate response to the need for cooperation between all institutions of the European Union in the interests of a well functioning, citizen-focused system.
Thus, the number of young people aged 0 to 14 would drop from 100 million to 66 million in 2050.
The European Union needs Serbia and Serbia needs the European Union.
On 21 April, the Commission will publish its yearly spring development package of proposals to Member States.
All of this has been fiendishly planned.
We are of the mind that we can improve it, prioritise it and, above all, deliver it with you, because we urgently need to restore growth and competitiveness along with citizens and businesses.
Nevertheless, recent events indicate a worrying trend in Russia; for example, the use of energy resources as a tool for exerting pressure, including cutting off supplies, or the Georgia crisis last summer and subsequent events.
This has therefore been dealt with in the text.
That is fine - provided it does not create difficulties for the implementation of the Seventh Framework Programme - but it does not sound as though it will be enough.
All those concerned understand the need to conclude by June.
This is the conclusion that can be drawn from the rejection of the proposed amendments tabled by our parliamentary group which reiterated that outer space must be used for exclusively peaceful purposes and that outer space must be used for exclusively non-military purposes, thereby rejecting any direct or indirect military use.
on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, International Women's Day gives us a united opportunity to focus on issues and challenges women face today - to focus on the various forms of inequality that many women experience, but also to celebrate achievements by women throughout the century.
Decision on urgent procedure
That is important, in my opinion.
in writing. - The phenomenon of organised crime is something that the European Union needs to tackle head on.
Can I suggest, in the light of our reaction to the French, Dutch and Irish referendums, that we simply disregard the votes and carry on as we wanted?
Examples of disparity in criminal law at national level are many and varied.
To spell it out, we also expect a revision proposal for the current financial perspective.
An agreement had been reached to work on indicative guidelines.
I was doing it to ensure you had all the information, but you can read it so I will not read it out.
(The sitting was closed at 10.30 p.m.)
Independent verification procedures are also provided for by these agreements.
Greater efforts are needed to help developing countries to invest in low-carbon technology.
Back in 2000, the United Nations in New York included that objective in its Declaration on the Millennium Development Goals.
Therefore, we must endeavour to find a way of monitoring those resources and ensuring that they are used for development purposes.
I also have high hopes of the European financial coalition against commercial images of child pornography.
Given recent events in Libya, it is crucial that we continue to campaign for and seek to defend human rights at an international level.
As far as the cohesion policy's urban dimension is concerned, we know that we do not have a common definition for 'urban'.
In many places there are not enough suitably qualified veterinarians to monitor compliance with the regulations effectively and regularly enough.
Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new approach to economic governance, to create a true economic union, to improve coordination and to harmonise financial and even fiscal policy.
The current text is simply off-putting to most highly qualified workers considering legal immigration to the EU.
(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, you are known for your pragmatism and sense of realism, but I would say with all due respect that I do not see the Nabucco pipeline as final or as quite such a given.
Thank you.
You are wrong.
Not all the amendments made by this House to the proposal by the Commission and the Council are along the right lines.
Events in Belarus are very clearly a message and wake-up call for the European Union in terms of the responsibilities which it must assume in such cases.
I consider the constant interference by Morocco to be unacceptable.
A responsible and flexible attitude is required of both the Council and Parliament, and I firmly believe that in today's situation, the agreement would send a remarkably positive message to the markets as well.
To this end, Madam President, advance planning is needed and I can say, Madam Vice-President, that our political Group will support the Commission in this work.
We are emerging from the crisis with a stable and more effective institutional structure that is open to further developments.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, we are here to present a combined view on certain aspects in the fight against terrorism.
Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to say that the majority of governments and citizens only remember the victims of terrorism after a serious attack such as the ones in Madrid, New York or London.
However, once again, this linguistic debate is not on the agenda.
The major weak point is the lack of coordination over the enormous number of activities.
I therefore concur with you that European industry should target the new and fast-growing emerging markets.
• resolute maintenance and execution of the arms embargo on Somalia,
- (SK) I would like to start by thanking Mrs Thyssen, due to whom we have achieved a commendable compromise, as a result of which our children will be protected from undesirable materials in toys and which at the same time will not cause any harm to industrial firms.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Bildt and Mr Rehn for their help in bringing about at least a temporary solution to the border dispute between Slovenia and Croatia.
It must be acknowledged that it has withstood a lot of market turbulence.
It penalises developing countries by calling for a delay in phasing out export refunds in the worst kind of blatant protectionism.
(PT) Mr President, the crisis in Japan has given further meaning to our collective commitment to creating a 202020 Strategy.
Ongoing confrontation between the political parties and the lack of readiness on the part of the government and the opposition to work towards consensus on key reforms mean there is no visible impact, and in some areas, the situation is worsening, particularly as regards freedom of the press.
It is important when we have these debates that we keep that in mind: it is important to have urgencies, but get all your people here.
Mr President, there was a wonderful symbolism this morning.
I voted in favour.
At present, Member States are not required to make the convention directly applicable within their domestic law.
This method has proved to be a very important incentive for the countries of the region to progress towards reforms, notably in relation to document security, with the introduction of biometric passports and identity cards for border control and global policies on migration, and also in relation to public order and security policies: the fight against organised crime, corruption, human trafficking, and finally, of course, fundamental rights, including matters of citizenship.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Reul's report is a very good and thorough report and I congratulate him on it.
We are, of course, using full transparency.
We should keep in mind, however, that there is no use in closing a few gaps allowing illegal immigrants to pass through if all the EU Member States do not react as one to denounce the Schengen Agreements and to re-establish real controls at all their borders, both on land and at sea.
The importance of improved energy savings is undeniable.
Last Thursday, I issued a clear statement to make absolutely sure that a message is sent to our Turkish colleagues that Turkish law does not sufficiently guarantee freedom of expression in line with the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Court of Human Rights, and to make it absolutely clear that Turkey urgently needs to amend its legal framework to improve the exercise of freedom of the press both in practice, and in a significant manner.
What we need are binding recommendations from the Commission.
The various Community funds are designed to stimulate the European economy and foster, socio-economic cohesion and growth and sustainable development of European societies.
Lastly, I voted in favour of the references to the need to avoid overusing the Kyoto Protocol flexibility mechanisms, since Europe must actually reduce its emissions if it wants to retain its leading role in international negotiations and secure a global agreement in Copenhagen.
Now is the time to start the single digital market.
The Commission's proposal thus provides the opportunity to eliminate this risk that is being taken when intra-community trade takes place.
That is why any evaluation of the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities should be linked to the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy and its implementation.
At the North Pole global warming is sharpening appetites for control of the area's natural wealth.
That is not the case.
Furthermore, the BSS is an example of excellent cooperation between the main institutions of the EU.
The Commission stands ready to work towards a rapid solution that is agreed by all the institutions concerned.
Secondly, Commissioner, I was shocked to hear you say you are still not in possession of that dossier.
All these reasons have led us to vote against this agreement.
By presenting the Europe 2020 strategy right after taking office, we have set the scene to help bring Europe back on track - on track for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.
Just like the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, the Environment Committee takes the view that the transitional periods proposed by the Commission were far too long.
Is it not the case that in the next few weeks, your group will vote in favour of the discharge of the Council in the Committee on Budgetary Control, although the Council has not given adequate responses?
This cannot happen, it is simply impossible.
From the perspective of future developments, I personally consider it vital firstly to align the role of local authorities correctly in managing European funds and secondly, to target European funds at supporting the use of modern technologies.
It is only right, therefore, that Bulgaria should be treated at least as well by the European Union as other countries that have had to close prematurely their ageing nuclear facilities, and I am glad that the Commission recognises this.
I would highlight the vital role of this Agency in the future of energy policy in Europe, which we want to be characterised by more competitive and diverse conditions, far removed from the monopolies of the past, together with conditions of increased security and better efficiency, to the benefit of consumers.
It is therefore becoming more and more difficult to ensure consistency.
(GA) Many people in the area affected by the earthquake are waiting for help that has not yet arrived.
It is often the case that a problem is impossible to address due to a lack of money.
This is because, along with the financial crisis, the world is also facing the threat of an energy and food crisis.
It recognises the prime role of Member States in promoting the health and safety agenda.
Without it, you might as well say, 'Oh well, fishermen today do not want to do anything!'
This is absolutely appalling.
I therefore thought that both women and men would speak today, because it benefits us all, not only women, and I think that the European Union has made a very intelligent commitment to gender equality.
Mr President, honourable Members, the last time I was here in Parliament to discuss climate issues was just before I met with my colleagues at the October meeting of the Environment Council.
I have been critical of serious shortcomings in the Veterinary Medicines Directive now for some time.
(Applause)
Sweden therefore emits 60 times more, and the EU 100 times more, than Ethiopia, to take just one specific example.
- Motion for a resolution: Galileo
By giving its consent to enhanced cooperation, the European Parliament is showing just how interested it is in this particular enhanced cooperation procedure - and I would point out that this is the second time it has been applied - but it is also sending a very positive and very specific message to promote the innovation and competitiveness of our businesses.
This is because the shock envisaged by the EBA would only have an impact on sovereign debts held in the banks' trading book.
Serbia will not be able to secure candidate status until it demonstrates that it is fully cooperating with the Hague Tribunal, as stated in the Council conclusions of 25 October 2010.
Indeed, given the fact that we have shared the same market for decades, why is it that size systems and many other, equally important, items of information still vary from one Member State to another?
I would like to take this opportunity to thank you, Mr President, and also the General Secretariat under the leadership of Klaus Welle, for leaving nothing to chance and providing us with the best possible working conditions.
What happens at the moment is that people comply with restrictions in their own country but, as soon as they cross the border, they grow a lead foot and cannot get the accelerator off the floor, precisely because they need not worry about having to pay a fine.
in writing. - (PT) The report on which we have voted today on the interoperability of the Community rail system is most important as an incentive for investment in rail transport and is vital for creating genuine freedom of movement in the European territory.
Since 2000, the European Parliament has, on dozens of occasions, called in its resolutions for progress to finally be made on the European patent - with a view to the Lisbon process and the new 2020 process.
Standardisation of healthcare in Europe will take into account the quality of services offered, which must be consistent for citizens of all 27 Member States, irrespective of wealth and the ability to pay, if we are to complete the internal market as far as healthcare is concerned.
Complementing all of this will be a discussion on 22 October in Lisbon with the 27 Member State ministers responsible for maritime affairs, which will include ministers of transport, fisheries, the environment and defence, amongst others.
Disabled people, migrants and semi- and unskilled workers are still all too often left to their fate, whilst we need everyone in society and everyone in the labour market.
Does the European Commission understand 'common visa policy' solely to mean laying down uniform rules for third countries within the internal EU area?
This needs to be counteracted, which is why it is so crucial and so important that the Stability and Growth Pact must not be undermined or discarded.
It creates legal chaos.
Thank you for your attention.
I would like to highlight that for the country which I represent, Romania, these amendments will help double the Community funds which can be invested in renovating the heating systems in residential blocks.
It establishes readmission procedures - readmission requests, information, documents provided, proof, means of proof, deadlines, means of transfer, transport, transit, etc., unlike the case of the European Union-Pakistan readmission agreement, which you perhaps remember, and which I strongly opposed a few months ago.
The debate is closed.
Many people are under the impression that the vote is not due to start until 19.30. I would therefore ask you to ring the bell one more time.
The main points were also covered by 426 amendments tabled to the lead committee and to the other seven committees, which gave their opinions.
For this reason, I am pleased that a total of 1 900 petitions were submitted, which represents an increase over 2008.
In order to guarantee greater transparency of the organisation's debates and work, provision should be made for better information, dialogue between the organisation and representatives of civil society, and public access to meetings, particularly for the dispute settlement procedure.
Two years ago we saw Russia cut the supply of gas to Ukraine at Christmas time.
We have the diplomatic means to break the spiral of violence and start the process of constructive dialogue.
Attention is drawn to the fact that partnership needs to be broadened from cohesion policy to Single Market policies.
This is why the European Union needs coherent policies in this area, which, at the same time, will offer European farmers the opportunity to be competitive on the global market.
In the interests of the future development of strategic relations between the EU and Russia, it is vital to establish a reciprocal visa-free travel regime as soon as possible; this is crucial for progress in EU-Russian relations.
Therefore, the costs of these vehicles must remain manageable.
Europeans must, of course, be the friends of the peoples and the allies of freedom.
We do, of course, have many unresolved issues and perhaps none of us believes that we will resolve all of the issues at the summit in Stockholm.
I would like to respond to Mr Kožušník by saying that we are indeed a community of values, and I would like to point out that in the last part-session, we adopted an important resolution on Cuba in which we called for the immediate and unconditional release of political prisoners.
I think it is a very good investment, especially now in difficult economic times, to see how consumers are treated, because this gives good information about the market.
I would also like to thank Mr Maňka for his work on the budget for other institutions.
But the progress report is much more: it is about providing the input of ideas on how we should proceed in the future.
He was quite right.
One of my proudest achievements in this Parliament was my role in this Parliament's resolution calling for Nigeria to hand over Charles Taylor to the Court, which is what eventually happened through the mediation of the UN.
When we talk about food security, agriculture and development, we often forget the issue of water scarcity, an essential problem now and, above all, in the future.
They will not run away with the money.
The situation seems to be tragically without a solution, and that is why it is the moral obligation of the European Parliament to painstakingly monitor events in the region, and regularly insist on respect for rights which the citizens and human rights organisations in the Russian Federation still cannot enjoy on a day-to-day basis despite official rhetoric.
The public, on being given a chance in the Republic of Ireland, made it absolutely clear that they do not want it and if the people of Britain were to be given a chance - and they should have been because they were promised it in the last general election by the Labour Government - they would also vote overwhelmingly to reject this Treaty.
We therefore all agree on that point.
We need to be constantly vigilant and alert to ensure that toys that are sold do not endanger the health and safety of children.
This budget has to meet major challenges such as the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon if it is ratified by the Member States, the fact that 2009 is an election year for Parliament and the entry into force of the new Statute for Members
For this simple reason I am abstaining, since despite agreeing with the aims of the document, I cannot tolerate the manipulation of policy.
(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, your words are in line with what we wanted to hear.
How can we fight this?
We need to pay particular attention both to nuclear power stations already in operation and to those in the planning stage.
The EUR 0.45 million will be used to retrain and support workers through a difficult transition.
But throwing back into the sea dead fish that have already been caught and are good for the table is surely the opposite of sustainability.
These regions do not ask whether Europeans agree amongst themselves or whether they are implementing new redistribution programmes.
This is why we should, perhaps, adjust our priorities and projects, particularly in the context of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development.
There is more to come as the Commission works towards meeting the Council of Transport Ministers' expectations, as expressed in their conclusions of 4 May 2010.
Will the next European Council adopt measures to ensure that the European Union as a whole sets the world an example in this area too?
Which instruments do we need to bring together?
Madam President, Bavaria and its municipalities have many contacts all over the world, as does the Catholic University of Eichstätt.
We must all feel once again that we are involved in combating death on European roads by seeking effective and sustained solutions for applying the new technologies to the road transport sector.
I am grateful for the praise which has kindly been expressed today, and I would like to pass it on to the staff behind the scenes who worked extremely hard on this report.
The review of ten years of the euro area is positive.
In view of the high level of interdependence between the budgets of the Member States and the EU budget, budgetary forecasts at both levels should be characterised by the same degree of transparency.
(Applause)
Even in countries with extremely high safety requirements, this safety may prove deceptive.
I would like to return to the statement that Parliament adopted on 23 June 2010.
(FR) Over and above the figures cited by our estimable colleague, Mr Guerrero Salom, out of the 829 million inhabitants of Sub-Saharan Africa, about 240 million are starving, that is to say, 30% of the population.
After all, Southern Sudan is one of the poorest countries in Africa.
In the next report on the subject, women's health should not be seen solely in relation to reproduction, for all women have the right to an environment that allows them to enjoy continuing good health.
Small and medium-sized enterprises are going through a particularly difficult period, since both the Member States and the European Central Bank were unable to control and ensure that funds earmarked for the banks were allocated for the main goal - the provision of preferential loans to small business.
In accordance with the legal basis of Article 165 of the treaty, the Council Recommendation on measures to combat neurodegenerative diseases calls for Parliament to be consulted.
This 'supposed rescue' package will do little to ensure a sustainable fishing industry.
Madam President, as we are unfortunately required to spend part of this evening together, I shall try, on behalf of the Council and also of Commissioner Potočnik, to summarise the Council's aims concerning demographic trends and their economic and social impact.
However, as of today, we have not received any response, which demonstrates the Commissioner's inability to react to a situation that would have deserved immediate action.
Concerning the initiative taken by the Commission on damages actions for breach of the European anti-trust rules, I can assure you that the Commission shares Parliament's view that these two initiatives related to collective redress should be consistent.
Our democracy is based on representativeness, which is put into practice through political parties.
We call on the Commission to take into consideration all these deliberations on flexibility and improved conduct of negotiations in the context of budgetary policy annually and multiannually during the deliberations on the review of the multiannual financial plan in the autumn.
The impact assessment accompanying the review proposals states that the European authority would contribute to improving the efficiency of decision-making, most of all in decision-making concerning cross-border actions.
I am sure that with the experience gathered from this project, the innovative financing tools can be used in other areas as well.
The debate is closed.
Madam President, it is always more difficult to conclude a military operation than it is to start it, and in order to be able to conclude it, we must keep in mind the initial objective, which was to ensure that the al-Qaeda camps were dismantled.
Most kinship carers are grandparents and find themselves being the main caregivers for their grandchildren, normally because the parent either has a drug addiction or has died through that drug addiction.
I have noticed two types of reaction: firstly, our citizens are wondering why the European Union is meddling with rosé, when there are so many other issues to worry about, particularly the serious issue of the economic crisis.
I hope that the possibility of reviewing the recommendations on the basis of the economic downturns can also contribute to its success, provided that it does not threaten fiscal sustainability.
I also agree that:
He leads opinion; he does not follow opinion.
We, the MEPs representing the peoples of Europe, have a duty to use our influence to respond to the request of our fellow citizens, but above all to shoulder the responsibility that we have, so that we can meet the IPCC's target of a 25-40% reduction by 2020.
The text now on the table reinforces the security of our legal chain of supply for medicinal products, but let me emphasise that only 1% of falsified medicines reach our patients via this legal chain.
This draft report broadly supports the European Commission's proposal, in particular, on the need to make available, by 1 January 2013, the 800 MHz band freed up by the changeover to digital television and the complete cessation of analogue television broadcasting.
Sociological research shows that the greater the percentage of migrants in the EU, the more dissatisfied local people are with their way of life.
I demand a 'Europe 2020' planning committee involving the Commission, the Member States, the European Investment Bank, the European Central Bank and Eurostat.
What is happening at this moment in time is that a large slice of intra-European tourism is heading for countries outside the European zone - the Caribbean, the developing world, the Far East, Africa - largely due to this increase in the value of our European currency.
I would like to say that it proved possible to avoid discussing issues other than adapting in this document.
Now I would like to address not only all my fellow members in this Chamber, who are about to put the final seal on our work to introduce a new maritime package, but also all the European Union citizens that you represent.
Eight is a lucky number in Chinese culture and is associated with good fortune and prosperity.
For the fifth consecutive year, Turkey has failed to comply with Europe's requests.
The opening of the secretariat in Barcelona has been postponed indefinitely, and the money promised cannot come in.
Since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament has had more powers to intervene in the conclusion of international agreements between the European Union and third countries.
(The oral amendment was accepted)
It destroyed people's moral values, traditions, solidarity, and self-confidence.
We have made clear in this report - and rightly so - that, where competition rules are infringed, Parliament stands by the view that, according to the European tradition, it is primarily the task of the authorities - both the national competition authorities and the European competition authority - to take action and that this is not creating a second arm, as it were, on an equal footing with official action in the fight against cartels.
Is it in Italy that we change the law on audiovisual advertising in favour of our friends?

Therefore it is an individual responsibility for all of us to contribute to maximise energy efficiency.
On the one hand, these measures affect the free movement of the citizens of my country and primarily the opportunities for young people to have the same rights and chance which people of their age enjoy in other countries; on the other hand, they generate economic problems for countries like Bulgaria, which have relatively small ports and will have to shoulder the heavy financial burden of providing the new screening equipment.
In June 2010, only about half the Member States had implemented the directive - more than half a year late.
in writing. - (EL) The Commission proposal on which the report has been drafted creates an information and warning network between the Member States for their public and private infrastructures which are characterised as being 'critical'.
Several rapporteurs have already mentioned that someone wants to extend the right to submit a citizens' initiative to people who are not citizens and someone else wants to be able to decide on the voting age in other Member States and so on - something that we have not been able to agree on.
It is quite logical that on occasions we might need more time to take decisions.
Mr President, I am going to answer the questions raised by Mrs Flašíková Beňová and Mrs Flautre on a matter which directly affects human rights, which affects all of us, and which also affects a large community, because the Roma population, as you are aware, is the largest ethnic minority living in the European Union, and it cannot be said that they have the same standard of living as the average European citizen.
We should not merely support but absolutely insist on respect for human rights both within the EU and in its external relations.
This report lacks ambition.
In order to do this, it is absolutely vital that we guarantee an effective system of equivalence of qualifications, not only in terms of degrees and diplomas, but in terms of training for employees throughout their working lives.
Mr Sarkozy is very obliging, and does not see that Russia has increased its military presence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
It is simply not true that all the problems we are now facing involve a tsunami, something caused by Nature.
Al Gore's infamous film confirmed that view.
in writing. - (EL) I should like once again to congratulate the rapporteur on this excellent report.
Unemployment among the under-25 age group has reached 21.4% in the EU: double that of the population average.
This is no easy task and some of the negative features of the previous system have lived on in new guises.
The revision of the timeshare directive excludes the registration of unreliable service providers and thereby increases the chances that people will not fall victim to fraud as is all too often the case today.
We are already over time.
Granting immunity to members of a legislative body, an instrument which has been disputed on countless occasions, is intended to give them the freedom to express their opinions.
(The Minutes of yesterday's sitting were approved)
Most importantly, the Commission will be obliged to indicate the exact reasons for refusal of an ECI, as well as indicating exactly how it intends to follow up on a successful initiative.
The car industry already entered into a voluntary agreement on the reduction of CO2 ten years ago and has had an enormous amount of time to adjust to the rules that are necessary if we are to combat global warming.
In my opinion, the matter of rail transport should be tackled decisively and quickly.
One solution might be the use of model contracts.
What message does the Council and Commission have for them?
I would like in particular to thank many Members for their support in organising a public hearing on the issue of 'European Conscience and Crimes of Totalitarian Communism' last week in Brussels, where we were together with Commissioner Figeľ.
Let me make that quite clear.
Reference is also made to the huge importance of ensuring that the education provided meets the needs of the labour market and provides the skills and knowledge needed by the young people of Europe.
I particularly welcome the proposal to create more jobs by encouraging employers to invest in young people.
(DE) Commissioner, I should be interested to hear your views on the situation surrounding the relevant market power exercised over such modes of distribution.
This initiative gives the European School system the opportunity to better fulfil the needs of SEN children.
Therefore, this is not the right term to use as it is misleading.
In Italy judges do not have civil liability for miscarriages of justice - this is a grave social injustice and must be put right.
I have just seen Simeon Sakskoburggotski, the former Prime Minister of Bulgaria, in the gallery.
We have no relevant national laws in many countries.
Let me remind you of two examples.
Japan is the EU's sixth largest trading partner and the EU is Japan's third largest trading partner.
Consumers must be aware of their rights.
However, implementation means that companies, farmers and local councils have to put policies into practice, which is not always easy.
Even though the first experiences from this procedure are positive, it is crucial to keep on building trust between institutions. The working relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission in this process are very important.
In some of what I believe are key areas, the report proposes criteria for selecting these projects.
I should explain that the Commission will already have representatives in Washington on Tuesday and Wednesday to start the negotiations formally.
That is why it was deemed necessary to amend Regulation (EC) No 377/2004.
The expense in terms of time and money involved in complying with these regulations is out of all proportion to the benefits for the final recipient of the funding.
Forests make up biospheres which store carbon and are particularly important to environmental conservation and protection against natural disasters.
We were the vanguard of freedom, even right next to Franco, and anyway it was not necessary to talk about borders because they were drawn by an Iron Curtain.
Undoubtedly, the clashes of the rebels in the eastern provinces will bring more and more violence, including sexual violence.
Budget discipline and the implementation of reforms must be rewarded by admission to the euro area.
I agree with the rapporteur's proposal recommending the introduction of more ambitious limit values for particulate emissions (going beyond the European Commission's proposals) in order to guarantee high levels of protection of human health and the environment, particularly with regard to mitigating the effects of climate change.
It had, in fact, been going on for many years.
This requires separately allocated radio spectrum in order to guarantee troublefree connections.
We need both these factors, Commissioner Dimas, and we shall continue to need good farming practice and integrated pest management, because we need dynamism.
It is an excellent report and it has my full support.
They did this deliberately, for shabby party-political reasons, to make it impossible for us to support the report as presented to plenary.
I therefore could not vote in favour of the report.
Madam President, I ask: is the answer yes or no?
Graham Watson asked how much we will have to pay.
Approval of Minutes of previous sitting: see Minutes
It is exceptional in that it was supplied by RosUkrEnergo, which is now out of the deal, but we are also working towards full restoration of gas supplies to all parts of the European Union that have been affected by the crisis.
I believe that these agreements are a positive step, not only because they draw a line under disputes in which the EU has been the losing party, with the ensuing consequences in economic and disciplinary terms and in terms of its institutional credibility as I already mentioned, but also because they lead to a balanced solution that respects the needs both of these ACP countries and of European producers in the outermost regions, who certainly cannot be abandoned to unbridled competition.
With regard to Croatia, conclusion of the accession negotiations, as stated in the conclusions of the European Council, is within reach, and our goal is to conclude the negotiations by the end of the Hungarian Presidency - provided of course that Croatia completes the remaining benchmarks for closing the negotiating chapters.
Aside from this particular situation, however, this decision more generally calls into question the European asylum system as a whole, particularly regarding one of its fundamental components - the Dublin regulation - and its main premise, the equivalence of national asylum systems within the Union.
What evidence does the Commission have to support this argument?
I consider, therefore, that we should refer this report back to the Committee on Development in order to agree on a legal base having the support of a clear majority of this House.
To my mind, it makes no economic sense.
I am speaking on behalf of a European and pro-Europe country, a country which, in the last 25 years, has experienced a major transformation in terms of progress and welfare, largely due to being part of the European Union.
Following Bali, it is clear that Europe, as a Union of 27 Member States, has the capacity and the ability to lead the world on this most critical of issues - climate change - with this package at its centre.
If we do not vote on them, we will not defer them to the next sitting.
I was particularly struck by Paragraph 15, in which the European Parliament 'calls on the Commission to strengthen the structural funds' potential through simplification, flexibility and improvement of procedures ... with the aims of helping Member States to optimise the output of social and employment policies and creating sustainable growth'.
This very balanced compromise text will hopefully facilitate the adoption of the proposal at a single reading.
I am referring to Mr Schmitt.
On the other hand, non-compliance with the Community rules in the field of agricultural expenses currently leads to the recovery of no less than 83 million euros by the European Commission from eleven Member States.
I would like to add that this is not only about the money, but also about taking decisive measures to counter racism.
The whole situation has gone so far that we are considering the establishment of a privatisation agency based on the German Treuhand model.
The Commission is also very interested in what is called 'the business model', which has been developed by the public-private partnerships, including the one presented by the TBVI.
It is an opportunity to reorganise the whole pan-European and global financial architecture.
Mr President, as has been said, this report includes two objects of concern.
I hope these points are convincing and that the upcoming events, especially the next conference on SSGI and poverty, will provide ample opportunities to discuss how to proceed.
How is it possible that there are between five and six million people in France living in flood zones?
The increasing concentration of media in the hands of wealthy patrons clearly stifles open debate.
I do not think there is a better place in Europe for the passion and the compassion that this Parliament can bring to bear.
We are talking about students, scientists, academics and others who, as part of their professional and/or academic work, need to travel between several Member States, and would not be able to do so under the existing legislation.
Research and development are crucially important to achieving the goals to which the European Union has committed itself under the Europe 2020 strategy.
This change can be regarded as an acid test.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 22 October 2009.
I have mentioned European actions that, unfortunately, do not bring the intended results.
I am, however, resolutely opposed to the calls for health warnings.
(Applause)
Madam President, I am aware that the current Polish government, and the Treasury Minister in particular, made a lot of mistakes last year.
I am convinced that we managed to reach a fine agreement on the issue.
In Europe, one in four women will experience physical acts of violence within her lifetime and more than one in ten will be a victim of sexual violence involving the use of force.
17.
(SK) Madam President, last week's visit by Commissioner Füle shows that the commitment of the Montenegrin Government to European integration is genuine and is the best path for a country that is moving towards the European Union.
I am not avoiding anything.
This is a serious incident.
in writing. - (PL) The creation of a common railway market for transport services requires changes to existing regulations.
Furthermore, I know from recent insolvency court cases in my own country, Ireland, and particularly in the construction sector, that the many late payments end up becoming bad debts and bring companies to their knees.
Finally, we have secured the basis for an industry with two million new jobs in Europe and research into green energy technologies, so I feel justifiably proud today.
author. - (NL) Mr President, in assessing what is happening in and around Iran at the moment, there are four issues to be considered.
Mr Barroso, I criticised you last week for demonstrating a lack of commitment.
It was also the intention of the Treaty of Lisbon and its copy, the so-called European Constitution, which the Irish, French and Dutch voted against, to do that.
Before a tsunami comes over us, we should take the measures and be proactive and prevent this type of thing from happening.
We would like to work with Russia in a constructive spirit in the search for solutions for these vexed issues.
(DE) Madam President, the borders have been removed for the first time in Germany and Austria and we finally have free movement for workers from the countries of Eastern Europe.
in writing. - Waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) represents the fastest-growing waste stream in the EU and we therefore face a range of challenges: 9 million tonnes now, growing to 12.3 million by 2020.
As for the very strange remarks by Mr Batten from UKIP and his reference to the next European elections, we shall see.
However, even in those areas that we would like to regard as areas of low-hanging fruit, as easy areas, it is impossible to reach agreement.
As a result, we must absolutely guarantee this premise.
Mr Mitchell, I do not want to say any more other than that I have a list and you can check the list.
What he wants are transparent borders - he basically wants Abkhazia and South Ossetia back - and he has, of course, also put the import ban on Georgian wines and mineral water on the agenda.
What is the substance of what you said?
I want to assure him that this is what we are doing in order to be able to combat maladministration and that the interactive guide has very much helped reduce maladministration in the institutions as a response to his question.
If the European Union wants to play an effective peacekeeping role, it needs to act now.
Mr President, at the very moment when the good people of Massachusetts were voting against excessive taxation and excessive government, our own Commission nominees were boasting of their plans to harmonise taxation in the European Union and create a separate revenue stream for Brussels.
The report that you have submitted is detailed and rich, as the Presidency pointed out.
I have followed labelling legislation for the last 15 years.
All workers have the right to work.
We agree entirely with what Jacek Saryusz-Wolski said a few moments ago about institutional improvements.
They invigorate the social dialogue between management and workers in more than 820 companies.
Furthermore, it has always played a constructive role towards regional integration in the Maghreb.
I firmly believe that today more than ever we must pay greater heed to the message of John Paul II.
The pursuit of profit at any price has brought the financial system crashing down.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, agricultural policy needs a coherent framework.
The irregularity rate for the EU funds paid out has never been as low as in this year.
This is interference in Polish affairs and in Polish sensitivities as regards Europe, the Polish nation and religion.

(FI) Mr President, over the centuries, people have left Europe for reasons of work and to escape war and political and religious persecution, and now Europe, with its stability, attracts people from outside Europe, and that is a good thing.
It envisages appropriate funds in its draft budget for 2012 to launch an EU-wide awareness campaign, plus training schemes for officials.
Mr De Castro is right.
That is crucial if we are going to be able to continue to have a common currency.
Mr President, I voted in favour of Mrs Herczog's report on the Small Business Act.
We need to adopt a more coherent approach in dealing with the area to the east of our borders.
I am conscious that our interpreters have been here for a long time.
(DE) Madam President, for us, it is relatively easy to talk, when human rights violations take place elsewhere and people are also dying for their beliefs.
The monitoring of the funds needs to be strict.
I am naturally astounded therefore at the votes to remove some of the abovementioned points requested by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group.
Regarding the accusation of racism, it is hard to find a more ethnically diverse and less racist county than Israel, which includes Arab, Armenian, Druze and other minorities in its society.
My second remark is on justice.
It also rejects protectionism.
I agree with the opinion that the main objectives of a Black Sea strategy should entail building a space of peace, stability and prosperity in the Black Sea region, as well as ensuring EU energy security.
The Union has a very important role in the international economy but, at the same time, it is also one of the main promoters of the respect for fundamental human rights.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
There are many praiseworthy statements about anti-discrimination and the importance of equal treatment in this report which deserve attention.
All of this is being provided by the EIB.
Verification that new Member States meet the conditions necessary for the full application of the Schengen acquis is a precondition for the adoption of the Council decision to abolish border checks at internal borders, after it has consulted the European Parliament.
Unemployment is the main cause of poverty in most countries in the European Union.
You were held captive for six years, four months and nine days.
To prevent the situation from escalating I wish to refrain from commenting, other than to say that the Conference of Presidents has taken the matter in hand.
One of the current aims is to find a way of facilitating the inclusion of 'cabotage' operations by road transport - in other words, carrying out up to three transport operations following an international journey, provided that these are carried out within seven days - in a market which is already so liberalised that this will profoundly impact on the finances and survival of national operators.
We have to learn lessons.
It is true that we need a solid legal base for this Code of Conduct that will allow us to look again at the current arms embargo against China.
This is the priority if we really want to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy.
Let us not be fussy and let us welcome this progress, since we know all the administrative formalities that are carried out in our embassies in order to issue visas to citizens of countries of the South.
3. on an EU-India Free Trade Agreement (
Even in the European Parliament, not everyone is convinced that climate change is a real threat.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, as Pakistan prepares for important parliamentary elections, the situation is, as we all know, very difficult and preoccupying, and I, also, like many of you, have to express that I was deeply shocked by the heinous bomb attack and assassination attempt in Karachi, when Ms Benazir Bhutto returned to the country last week, and also by the terrible loss of life, which has affected so many innocent people.
(DE) Madam President, we football fans are currently experiencing what is good about sport: team spirit, the joy of winning and, as yesterday evening, respect for the opposing team.
Does he accept however, that it is important that help is given to lesser used languages in their own context and not to tie them in too much with lifelong learning?
(The sitting was suspended for five minutes due to technical issues)
Actually, according to the ENPI Regulation, you were already supposed to have carried out an evaluation last year.
The report that was voted on in Parliament improves the directive, in particular with regard to the equal treatment of workers from third countries, as it prevents discrimination against these workers.
The debate on the global climate is not a European debate but a global debate.
(PT) Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteurs, particularly Mr Martin and Mr Corbett, and by saying that, as a member of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), my primary concern is with the proposed amendments to the Rules of Procedure.
And let there be no illusions about this.
We hope too that if we have a negative statement of assurance, we will have a negative vote from Parliament, so that there is political consistency between the bodies that have to take budgetary control decisions.
The European Union is still the only region in the world to have limited its emissions by law.
Agriculture represents a strategic sector for the European Union.
This will certainly not be an easy task, given the delicate nature of the matter and the potential impacts of decisions taken in this context.
It would also mean that the tax domain is one where there is still work to be done to make the most of the internal market.
This situation emphasises the need for a plan to aid the recovery and re-qualification of these former employees, so as to promote their reintegration into the labour market.
I voted in favour of the Batzeli report on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the European Year of Creativity and Innovation (2009), as I believe creativity and innovation are essential for Europe to be competitive in a globalised world.
European agriculture is aware of its important role as promoter and preserver of biodiversity.
From the crisis in Greece we can see that what has happened up to now is totally inadequate.
On this latter point, the best solution would be to allocate to the fund payment appropriations in its own right, as for other funds, but we know the Council's position on this subject and I fully understand what the Commissioner said.
I must thank all the rapporteurs on this text from all the political groups, with whom we have had much discussion and very good cooperation throughout this year, as we have been working together on this for a year now.
Huge potential lies dormant in the appropriate use of these by-products.
The progress achieved over time, including through the contributions made by EU Member States, can be undone by adopting a hasty approach based on commercial considerations.
Any remaining funds had to be invested in this project.
So while it is the nature of politics to focus on today's problems today, we must not be distracted from legislating now for the longer term, for the post-2012 scenario, on this most important of issues, or history will not judge us kindly.
As regards patents obtained with public funds, it is important that universities and private persons be able to share in intellectual property created in this way.
I would like to reiterate that it is the most vulnerable populations, including indigenous peoples, who are affected by climate change, and so their participation in policymaking, especially trade policy, is essential.
Yet here we have ideologues intent on foisting their precious social agenda on everyone, even where it is unwanted.
Flexibility needs to be reconciled with security in order to avoid situations in which low-skilled workers take low-skilled jobs for a low salary.
The freedom to provide services is one of the four fundamental freedoms of the internal market.
in writing. - (SV) The reports on milk products from the Agriculture Committee are a mixed bag.
We understand that the country has internal threats to its security and that there has to be a response to these, but democracy is not a threat to security.
They are two sides of the same coin.
If we make it easier for the citizens of Eastern Partnership countries to enter EU territory, they will discover how significant the benefits of cooperation with the EU can be.
We also support the proposed exclusion of organ transplantation from the scope of this directive.
Nevertheless, we can see that a number of groups are employing considerable resources and are doing all they can to influence decision making as much as possible.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for the constructive discussion we have had on the important issue of the relationship between the environment and health.
The right-wing dictatorships in Portugal and Greece were allowed to join in, there were bilateral agreements with a similar dictatorship in Spain, and the French colony of Algeria was forced to belong to NATO territory until 1962.
Moreover, if we really want to strengthen the European Union's common energy and climate policy, this intention must also be reflected in the next seven-year budget.
The European Parliament and its committee responsible for such matters, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, chaired at the time by Karl von Wogau and then by Christa Randzio-Plath, have also had a part to play as a driving force in this historic project over the years leading from the currency snake to the creation of the single currency.
The contacts with your delegation throughout the conference proved most useful.
I am voting for this report on an EU strategy for the Black Sea.
However, it did not solve all the problems.
Obviously, the personal data of internet users, such as IP addresses, ought to be protected.
I am confident that this deadline will be met.
I would like to reiterate that it was no easy decision, and I do not even think that it was the only decision and, in the debate over a compromise, a decent basis will surely be found, or at least I hope so.
We could have lost a whole year!
In the case of Northern Rock, they have spent half the Treasury money on trying to rescue it, and who knows if that is at an end.
Not everyone is familiar with how the close cooperation between schools and industry works - the dual system, that is - and not everyone is aware of the considerable investment in terms of skills, time and cost involved in gaining a master craftsman's diploma or recognition as a 'Fachwirt' (a non-academic professional qualification).
Everything that was criticised therefore no longer appears in the resolution adopted and I wanted to make this clear.
Then, of course, we also have the European elections.
I am also pleased to see the inclusion of the youth programme as one of the priorities for the coming year in the Commission's draft, but I am disappointed that there has only been a token increase in funding, when more was expected from these initiatives.
by Georgios Stavrakakis, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Police College for the financial year 2009 (SEC(2010)0963 - C7-0241/2010 -;
I must say that the motion for a resolution that we have seen appears to be highly appropriate and, moreover, we welcome the constructive attitude not to vote on the agreements for the time being and the fact that the motion for a resolution calls for a suitable mechanism for reviewing the agreements.
Therefore, we support the conversion of Europol into an agency, with the associated increase in budgetary control.
It deserves particular recognition for the manner in which it has solved the Rubik's cube with the appointments of Mr Van Rompuy and Lady Ashton.
Some studies on gender-based violence estimate that between a fifth and a quarter of Europe's female population have been victims of acts of physical violence at least once during their adult lives, and around one tenth of them have suffered sexual violence.
One minute they are solving the issue of flooding and the next minute the issue of drought.
The joint initiatives from the EIB and Commission in support of convergence have sought to encourage SMEs to access funding, develop micro-credits with a view to economic growth and create jobs, as well as provide support for sustainable investments in urban areas.
The other main guideline for the work in strengthening measures for financial stability concerns the tools for preventing, managing and resolving crises.
This amendment by the Greens is crucial and contradicts what Mrs Lynne depicted here as an illusion.
We know the goal that we need to get to, and we have to recognise that sustainability is a process that needs to have clear goals, but not all countries can move at the same pace. Those who have not yet begun to advance cannot be asked to do the same as the rest.
It is only the College of Commissioners that takes positions that are binding on the Commission.
That is where the contradiction in your statement lies.
The EU still seems to be an eldorado in the eyes of many illegal immigrants; they often find work and a quality of life here which they cannot find in their own country.
For this reason, we have drawn up Amendment 47, and I would ask for your support for this amendment in the interests of the developing countries.
With regard to socio-economic issues, he did not put forward anything different, which means maintaining the neo-liberal positions, the proposals rejected by the European Parliament on the Working Time Directive, the Stability and Growth Pact and the neo-liberal Lisbon Strategy, and he ignored the economic crisis and its serious consequences in the social dimension.
Thank you very much for your attention.
Fourthly, is the Commission satisfied with the level and frequency of inspections and supervision imposed by the Member State on this plant and its produce, given the Member State's obligation to have a risk-based official control plan?
In that sense, what Commissioner Dimas said here about the relationship between flexibility and effective implementation is extremely important.
I would like in particular to applaud the immediate public reaction of Commissioner Georgieva, who arrived in Santiago yesterday to visit the areas concerned.
This affair may bring unpleasant consequences in six months time in the elections to the European Parliament.
Jo, you were saying that if we did not vote this afternoon, the vote would take place next time.
The report submitted to you today and adopted unanimously by the members of the Committee on Development seems to me to represent a first step towards this necessary revision.
We are proceeding cautiously together with the social partners to see how changes might be made to the Swedish labour market model, but not in order to detract from it or to make fundamental changes to the way it works.
Welcome to Parliament.
(DE) Madam President, the Member States, Europol and Eurojust will now have to concern themselves on a regular basis with OLAF's findings.
Europe must take charge of this, and the European Union must focus its attention and efforts, including its economic efforts, in those areas that receive the most immigrants.
Deep-sea fisheries started in the late 1970s, developing rapidly from the 1990s onwards as a result of three factors.
I welcome the possibility granted to the Commission to adopt, in clearly defined cases, delegated acts under the urgency procedure in this regard.
As a global power in agricultural production, the EU needs to take account of and effectively adapt to emerging challenges, such as extreme weather conditions, limited availability of natural resources, dependence on food imports and increasing speculation in commodities.
Cohesion policy is a key policy for the EU.
Our economic and historical analysis suggests that this should be done in two ways: first, we need a family policy that will bring the birth rate back up, otherwise we shall not be able to fund our pension schemes in the decades ahead and, secondly, we need a policy to re-energise the single market and get people back to work.
Therefore, please vote in favour of our amendment not to include thrombin as an additive in our food regulation.
I hope we have not been too demanding on the Commissioner, because I think we will certainly be meeting him during future Parliamentary terms, and Mr Piebalgs has really worked very hard to make it possible even to speak of a European energy market.
A strong leader is required.
This right is enshrined in the treaties, including the Treaty of Lisbon.
Secondly, at a time of scarce public funding, the charging for external costs provided by the new directive will generate revenues and make new financial resources available for transport infrastructure.
Furthermore, it is obvious for this reason that the Schengen system - currently the 'one for all' Schengen system and soon to be Schengen II - must be equipped with the best technology.
I would like once again to thank the French Presidency, which has not only showed will, but has also proven its intelligence.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report by our Liberal colleague Olle Schmidt relates to a new confrontation between the House and the European Commission, which has proposed an unjustifiable increase in indirect taxes.
Thus, I am saying to the Spanish and Italian Members in particular that believe me, we do devote great attention to the equality, importance and use of languages.
Hitherto, there has been a fragmented patent system in the European Union, caused by the high costs and complexity of validating patents in individual Member States.
The EU has undertaken to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20%, to reduce energy consumption by 20% and to generate at least 20% of the energy consumed from renewable sources by 2020.
The post-crisis economic world will have coalesced into several economic power centres.
I am thinking of citizens who have huge difficulties in obtaining accurate information, and of the exit penalties - often in the form of high abandonment costs - which confront users wishing to switch from one credit institution to another.
That scam has already caused student riots.
It is something that should be raised in the context of the economic and social governance of Europe.
Baroness Ashton has the dubious honour of being the first EU official to combine a career in the Commission with a position in the Council of Ministers.
I think there are concerns still remaining about funding, to make sure that this House sees the results of this strategy that it deserves.
Individual Member States realise that more must be done to help this sector, which contributes greatly to economic growth.
The EU 2020 Strategy indeed has good intentions, in particular to reduce poverty, but it is a soft, voluntary option and governments will only follow it if they really want to and have the time.
I therefore agree with what Mr Lehtinen said in his speech.
Mr President, I hope that the House and you will allow me this short indulgence to congratulate you on the statement you have made on behalf of David Kato who was murdered in Uganda.
The 'EU Pilot' project, which was launched a year ago in 15 Member States to test the new method for reaction to complaints, could be extended to the other Member States, but the lack of information on assessment of its operation does not, unfortunately, allow Parliament to comment on this issue.
As a result, one of the most effective measures would be to increase pay through a fair distribution of income.
The free public expression of opinion and ideas is a guarantee of participation in the democratic process and makes possible free and fair elections and good governance.
(Applause)
The Joint Undertaking is in a start-up phase and had not yet fully established its internal control and financial reporting systems by the end of 2009.
This opinion relates to the proposal for a regulation on the effective enforcement of budgetary surveillance in the euro area.
Among these, Parliament expresses a wish for innovation not to be limited to technological aspects, but also to cover administrative, organisational and social innovations.
This will be a matter for very concrete work by the Commission.
I believe that it is time, beyond focusing on university studies or on professional training, as we have been doing, for us to concentrate on early childhood learning.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Commissioner, these are some of the expectations citizens have of the next G20, where Europe must speak with one voice, with determination and conviction.
In this regard, it is necessary to ensure that the information is accurate and complete.
The status of European citizens must not be used to settle the issue of the status of the Member States and even less so to revive tensions within them that are already strong.
I fully agree with the rapporteur on this.
Moreover, the Lisbon Treaty increases the degree of democratization, increasing the power of national parliaments and introducing the codecision procedure for most of the fields.
Taxpayers' money was wasted and we should not repeat this mistake.
author. - Mr President, Staff Sergeant Gilad Shalit has now been held hostage by the Jihadi fanatics of Hamas for over three years.
Many of us hope that the Home Secretary, Jacqui Smith, will now intervene on the basis of new evidence.
Everything we are hearing from the Commission at present - that is, every couple of months - indicates, however, that internal logic is showing that we need a revision of the European budget to demonstrate to the public that we have indeed understood, that we want to change things, that we need new priorities, that we want to spend more on research and development, and that we need new propulsion technologies.
(PL) Mr President, the extent of trade is indicative of the level of economic development.
However, we must not forget the earthquake in May and the destruction that left many tens of thousands dead and made millions homeless.
We completed negotiations on all of the key legislative proposals which the Presidency established as its objectives.
In this regard, the authorities of a state which makes no provision for divorce and which does not recognise the type of marriage in question will not be obliged to dissolve that marriage.
It improves the quality of public services, but most of all it opens up opportunities for industry to take the lead in international markets.
This document contains the draft of a budget reform for the period 2013-2020 which represents a U-turn in budget policy.
In the current situation it is absurd to settle more immigrants in Europe in such a forcible manner.
It sets the ceiling for financing, lists eligible countries and defines the extent of the support available to them.
But we have tried to address the issue of leakage in this report, making clear that it is absolutely unacceptable if there was a risk to human health.
There is no mixing of our two approaches - the industry approach, which includes the Toys Directive and the approach on which I base my activities, which includes a general product safety directive.
That should and must be done.
We now realise that these questions were probably justified.
This time, however, democracy won, because the biggest groups found common ground and the result achieved has the genuine support of the majority.
- Before the vote:
I am sure that the Commission will return to this later.
It has helped us open up national borders by sending a clear message to criminals that they may no longer flee to another country to avoid prosecution.
(PL) Mr President, I am impressed by this report's comprehensive approach.
All that is left for me to say is thank you all for this constructive and useful debate.
Therefore, we should raise the alarm in every instance of drastic violations in this area.
(PT) Madam President, those who are pushing Portugal into this supposed aid do not really want to help, rather they want to make money by sinking us and sinking the euro.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, we have heard today a clear message that we have a very serious challenge - that of the ageing of society.
It is also, and this is even more important, a more political budget, since we have - as Mrs Guy-Quint calls it - interinstitutional strategic programming, in other words, all of the bodies of the European Union agree to bring the budget into being.
In total, 33 pollutants (mainly pesticides and heavy metals) found in rivers, lakes and coastal waters will be subject to environmental quality standards.
Several presidencies tried very hard to break the stalemate but, after some years, the proposal was - well, maybe not really dead, but at least in a coma.
We know that many people without documents are exploited and live in miserable conditions.
If we want these regulations to prevent the rise in CO2 emissions, instead of encouraging them, sanctions are required.
I believe that it is desirable to implement this treaty as soon as possible as it will ensure that the EU operates more efficiently, more transparently and, above all, more democratically.
I know it is just a small part of the overall situation, but it will make such a positive difference to so many lives.
It is hard for them to evaluate the advice given and they may therefore be misled, falling victim to unfair selling practices
We should remember that only when many basic problems of everyday life have been solved will we be able to concentrate on the economic development of the Middle East and on close commercial cooperation with the region.
Better, more intensive cooperation encourages the exchange and dissemination of knowledge, both in business and in academia.
If Turkey cannot move forward with its internal democratic constitution, I believe that we will still have serious problems in some areas, quite apart from the deadlock in the Council.
That is very important.
It is time for the European Union to invest more in the field of research and innovation.
In line with this approach, the Council confirmed its commitment to protecting those who are most vulnerable in its conclusions on the situation of the girl child, which the Council adopted last year.
And if they have eased sufficiently, what sort of timescale are you talking about for the necessary reforms to be implemented in full so that the full negotiation process can get back on track?
(PL) Mr President, I would like to congratulate Iceland very sincerely on gaining candidate country status.
I welcome the pragmatic approach which has characterised these early contacts.
Vasile Bran's election was unjustifiably invalidated by the decision of the local council, while Iulian Mara could not take the oath as the decision which validated his position was contested through administrative legal proceedings by the Prefect's Institution for Braşov County.
France and Britain - two nation states - took the lead.
It should not involve any sort of legal hairsplitting.
The failure to act, President Van Rompuy, President Barroso, is feeding ammunition to Mr Farage and his allies.
We should not forget that, most of the time, migration is a consequence of poverty and the migration phenomenon itself generates instability and conflicts.
The key to the entire policy on Lebanon lies in Damascus.
It is true that the European Union needs a common asylum policy and needs to develop an attitude of solidarity in relation to admitting refugees.
As for the Blue Card, we must be able to welcome migrant workers, while making sure we do not pillage countries by holding on to the players needed for their development.
I also have reason to believe that increasing numbers of people disagree with that approach.
So could you please tell us also how you would guarantee that the European Commission, under your Presidency, would avoid the tendency - that sometimes is all too visible - of over-regulating rather than deregulating or better regulating?
I believe that this proposal fits in perfectly with the European Action Plan for Sustainable Production and Consumption and, consequently, with the general aim of developing a voluntary, integrated system that will encourage companies to improve their products with a view to improving product quality in terms not only of diet and consumer protection, but also of the environment, by achieving higher standards of energy efficiency and environment-friendliness.
I would like to emphasise that as well as meeting genuine market demand and expanding the range of products on offer, we must help to improve the already difficult situation of producers.
We are at the stage of the first reading of the draft directive on consumer rights, submitted by the Commission.
Domestic violence incidents are estimated to affect 1 200 000 people every year, yet only 1% of the victims of violence are brave enough to report it to the authorities.
The first victim was Greece, followed by Spain and Portugal.
Firstly, we must increase the safety standards of the existing power stations, in particular, using the stress tests that are currently carried out in the Member States.
European Union law recognises this, as you have laid out, Commissioner.
The European Parliament supports the rights of drivers and refuses any competition between salaried and self-employed drivers.
Since then it has been repeatedly said that somehow we are not succeeding.
In fact, the modelling of relations between the Commission and Parliament is - rightly, in my view - derived from this, in the manner that has already been tested and whipped into shape over decades (if not centuries) in each of the Member States.
The existing budget line needs some money and some credibility.
Madam President, on behalf of my group, I should like to table an oral amendment to this paragraph.
The US should drop its extradition request and let him be prosecuted, if at all, in the UK.
Secondly, I believe it is important to ensure greater support and provision of services for patients and their families.
But we are not using the 'catch the eye' procedure.
In this context, there is some concern at proposals regarding access to resources that aim to promote a system of transferable individual quotas, which would have consequences in terms of the concentration of fishing activity and the individual appropriation of fishing rights.
Another 500 will lose their jobs in the coming month, with a further 1 500 workers threatened further down the line.
I should also like to remind you that, obviously, these two agreements go hand in hand, as, on the basis of the common approach, in principle, an agreement on facilitation of the issuance of visas can only be concluded if a readmission agreement exists.
All investment agreements must be accompanied by a set of appropriate environmental and social rules as a form of additional guarantee.
What happens is that there is a petition for a referendum, then, when enough people have put their name to it, there is the possibility of a referendum.
Your personality has very much left its mark on these decades and you have made a significant contribution to shaping the development of Parliament.
I therefore also regard it as legitimate to ask whether the analysis promised by the European Commission, concerning a reduction of the administrative burden to 25% of its current level, is available yet.
Providing Minsk is really willing to improve cooperation with the EU, this should create more favourable conditions for the kick-off of mutual discussions, not only externally but also domestically.
denounces the frequent lack of any parliamentary scrutiny over the negotiation and approval of these agreements, with national parliamentary approval only being required in seven Member States;
Thank you very much Mr President.
This is why I consider it absolutely necessary to launch the 'Safer Internet' programme in order to protect children who are using the Internet and new technologies.
(The President cut off the speaker)
I think we have succeeded in drawing up a suitable plan with this gas compromise.
Air transport agreements now fall within this category because they cover a field to which the ordinary legislative procedure applies.
Because we need to find funding for these priorities, we need, of course, to monitor unnecessary spending and administration costs.

Doubts about the consequences of transposing this directive in the individual Member States and the deletion from the text of the amendment approved by our Member in committee induce me to abstain.
We are primarily concerned with the fact that the US has used a 'divide and conquer' strategy, apparently with impunity.
Last but not least, we must fund fewer projects.
As you all know, this is a matter close to the hearts of the Swedish Government and the Swedish people.
Mr President, the departure of Hosni Mubarak signals the transition towards a pluralist democracy responding to the aspirations of the Egyptian people.

I hope that what Commissioner Tajani has said on several occasions comes true.
I myself had the opportunity, during the meeting of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on 22 July, to explain the workings of the TFTP and why we need an interim solution to prevent its interruption.
I agree with the rapporteur that it must be conceived so that it is in harmony with future cohesion policy, and that the 2020 strategy must also be implemented at regional and local level, something that failed to happen with the Lisbon Strategy.
That only increases the risk of the mistakes being repeated.
We have expressed a lot of goodwill towards President Obama and commitment to transatlantic relations.
I believe this would be the time for Parliament to come in and provoke a real debate on how the charter is being applied in practice.
The real challenge is to prevent non-LDCs from slipping into a disastrous trading situation on 1 January.
In the case of the creative industries, I believe that it is very clear that Europe has probably the highest concentration of potential for the creative industries.
Who is knocking on the door of the European Union?
What we are doing at present is actually spending even more.
If you accept that that is true even for you, then we are on the same level.
Yet they were called to arms!
It is true that the rapporteur has done a magnificent job but I believe that we should not tackle the group of final amendments on the content of the Net here, in this directive, because in short what those amendments do is allow intermediate service providers to filter and block content on the Net and therefore, ultimately, consumers will lose their anonymity.
Thank you for your attention.
On 26 April 2010, the Committee on Fisheries and the Legal Service of the European Parliament expressed serious doubts about the legal basis chosen by the Commission to draw up the agreement.
It is a fact; it is the reality.
This also applies to sensitive issues outside the remit of Union arrangements, such as the publication of data on passenger movements.
One of the core objectives of the European Union is to have an area without barriers.
By doing so, Europe sets the tone.
The Swedish Presidency of the Council has recognised that, in the current economic crisis, the key priority is that Member States must be able to respond jointly to challenges and find solutions for overcoming the economic and financial crisis and, above all, reducing unemployment and its adverse social consequences.
We must show the reality on the ground and stand up for a right to inspect these centres - something that these kinds of visits permit - and we must do so in order to take action so that things change.
It also welcomes the European Council decision of 17 December 2010 to grant Montenegro the status of candidate country for accession to the European Union, but regrets, however, the decoupling of candidate status from the right to open negotiations, stressing that the decision to start them should not be unduly or unreasonably postponed, and expects the negotiations to start at the latest after the publication of the 2011 Commission Progress Report, provided Montenegro makes good progress in fulfilling the benchmarks set by the Commission.
Safety of workers and the flexibility required by businesses are extremely important; that is why, today, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats - which is based on these foundations of equal treatment, on access to vocational training, and on the procedures for representing temporary workers in accordance with collective agreements - has sought to make progress with this work, too, and reach a consensus.
We owe this to our citizens.
I am pleased to see that the Slovenian presidency has said that they will take this on board, and I would call on the Council of Fisheries Ministers when it meets next week to pay particular attention to this resolution.
The EU's delegation has already expressed in Sharm-el-Sheikh its agreement that the IGF should continue in its current form because of the important role that it plays as an instrument for open dialogue between all the actors involved in Internet governance.

If you want to see an end, finally, to this crazy situation in which a country such as Greece - as I said earlier - spends 4.3% of its GDP on defence, you will have our support.
It is important that we do not do something that we cannot do as a Parliament, but it is also very important to say that it is our right to have a view, to have an opinion on the Council's accounts, when these accounts are operational and where these operational accounts must be accounted for.
After 29 years I will leave this place to my successor, Hanne Dahl, and I will not be a Member during the coming asparagus season in May.
Mr Allister said that the directive was going to make regional airports more expensive.
This is my colleague Mr Kyprianou's proposal, which we are also discussing this evening on the basis of the report drafted by Mrs Breyer.
Part one:
This is exactly why the issue surrounding the exchange of information is relevant, where we must consider the decisions that have been made by international organisations that have really studied this matter such as, first and foremost, the OECD.
(Applause)
However, the centralised record of available technical equipment, as you know, is just a virtual record.
The parliamentary Committee on Regional Development also engaged in lengthy debates on the proposal.
We realise that the Europe 2020 Strategy has high ambitions and requires us to stand firm at both national and European levels.
In this sense, our Parliament is voting on its position on Mr Brok's report.
Clearly, we all want the agreement to be solid, to be fair for Europe, but I think that there are two main issues here.
We hope that negotiations can be concluded within this year. For our part, Croatia can count on our complete support.
That is exactly what today's debate shows.
Freedom of travel and travel possibilities mean that purely in quantitative terms, there is a very different level of importance than perhaps twenty or more years ago.
It is in this spirit that, a few days ago, I presented the draft regulations on derivatives and on short selling.
This policy on the part of the Commission is at complete odds with the idea of this European Union.
In the past, we have adopted several resolutions on that problem, including protection of minorities and anti-discrimination policies.
Madam President, amidst the angst and concern about the banking sector there is perhaps some hope.
In short, Austrian project manager OMV must immediately discontinue its stubborn attempts at a hostile takeover of group partner, Hungarian oil and gas firm MOL.
This resolution is a perfect example of that.

The creation and funding of a permanent European structure, which will gather and spread good practice in this area, as well as promote dialogue between the interested parties from every region of the European Union, will mark a new, important step towards encouraging sustainable mobility in urban areas.
Lastly, there is a need to improve the mixing zones and the knowledge of pollutants and sources of pollution, together with the monitoring of emissions.
Finally, my report focuses on those areas which not only require rapid action but also medium to long-term strategies, such as the integration of the Roma, the fight against child poverty and the issue of language use among minority communities, to name but a few.
However, there is currently no consensus between Member States on these tests.
However, the call for a European Union framework strategy on the integration of the Roma, including a directive on the inclusion of the Roma, has still not seen the light of day.
Unfortunately, the air in our cities only partly testifies to this.
I am happy that the Innovative Medicines Initiative will improve research conditions and with them the chances of developing better medicines for the treatment of neglected diseases.

However, it is clear that the pharmaceuticals industry makes a huge amount of money from the fact that the two products must always be sold together.
Thank you also, of course, to the Presidency and specifically to the representative of the Presidency, who has been conducting the five trialogue negotiations with us.
Ultimately we must work towards the goal which hopefully we all share, namely good chances of a decent quality of life for as many people as possible.
It strikes me about these annual debates on competition policy that there is a very friendly and polite exchange of views, and then the Commission just carries on with business as usual because the Commission has the exclusive powers in this area.
All political means should also be brought to bear to support the United Nations General Assembly resolution calling for an international moratorium on female genital mutilation.

We want the CAP to be more legitimate in terms of public resources pledged and accepted by the taxpayer, fairer in the distribution of European funds among the 27 Member States and among farmers, and more effective in the proper use of public money.
These goals are vital for maintaining the EU industrial, competitive and innovative base.
It is up to the Commission to resolve this issue.
I asked the President a question on 19 March.
I am pleased that the report by former Commissioner Monti, which has been generally praised, in which he argues for further development and completion of the internal market as 'a prerequisite for a highly competitive social market economy' has met with a ready response from the European Parliament.
This very topic was, however, given plenty of air time on the Belgian TV channel VRT that evening, so it seems that it had been leaked.
So, while I agree in principle, I had to abstain for the foregoing reasons.
Having said this, I want to thank and congratulate Parliament for its resolution on Europe 2020, which it adopted in Strasbourg two weeks ago with broad party support.
This has taken on an added importance in view of the recent issues in Gaza and the declarations in Cyprus.
Commissioner, Nautilus, Hermes and EUR 24 million mean more commitment and more equipment.
Youth unemployment within the EU has reached a high of 21%.
The United Kingdom, Germany, France and Italy wish to provide some tens of billions of euros in aid for the sector, and the Commission has in principle accepted this proposal unreservedly, despite the fact that such funding will distort competition on the market.
As regards the Fukushima power station, European unease is legitimate.

Mr President, I would like to thank the various speakers who, during the course of this debate, on the one hand have lent their support to the Small Business Act and on the other hand have insisted on rigorous and compulsory monitoring.
A number of those practical problems have come to light during the work on the Őry report.
In this context, I voted for the creation of a EUR 600 million fund in the budget planned by the EU for 2010 to provide assistance to milk producers, who are currently experiencing a serious crisis, unprecedented within their sector, and are wrestling with the laws of supply and demand on the world dairy market.
Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes
For example, if every Member State were to give to a third country the data that it places in European databases - let us say Schengen - you might end up having the third country collecting all the data in the Schengen database.
However, there is a very important aspect of this recast, this codification, that relates to all of the restructuring of TEN-T networks over the next decade.
(RO) Given that we have a timeframe of 10 years until 2020 and that notable results for reducing greenhouse gas emissions may be achieved in the area of energy performance in buildings and the transport sector, and that we are in the midst of an economic crisis and people are losing their jobs, we must emphasise that the green economy can create millions of jobs.
I hope the present resolution will initiate changes in the desired direction.
I hope that the Chamber will give its assent in the same way as the Committee, and I ask the Commissioner to make our case to the Commission and to remind it that the contribution of the inhabitants of mountainous areas is made on behalf of the entire population and benefits them accordingly and should therefore be duly acknowledged.
I can tell you, however, that I believe that the Greek Government, the Commission, the Eurogroup and Ecofin acted swiftly.
Although practical tests at national level have yielded quite positive results, opinions on these vehicles differ.
The two should be linked, not least in order to convince these infamous ministers of finance, who explain to us that perhaps even if the Solidarity Fund criteria were adapted - and you spoke about this - it would cost more.
If we think that the Commission's proposal is good, then we must support it.
The Union for Europe of the Nations Group supports the directive.
These are all specific steps, but more are needed if we are to change, first and foremost, our attitude in terms of preventing all forms of discrimination.
This is the case in Pakistan, for example.
That would certainly be a sound instrument.
I consider it cynical and unacceptable that Hamas uses the civilian population - even children - as a human shield.
Information should be provided on the basis of accessibility, consistency and absolute transparency, because we believe that many regions expect the Commission to show greater energy in relation to the objective expressed here.

Recently the Committee on Legal Affairs received a request from Mr Tomczak to defend his immunity.

The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the Accession agreement of the EU to the European Convention on Human Rights.
So let us proceed in the same way in which we have achieved those results, with persistence, vision, democracy and respect for each Member State.
The third condition, concurrent with the first two, is that the excess should not take the deficit very far above the reference value, and here, Mr García-Margallo - without going into technical details unsuited to the predominantly lay audience in this House - we are talking about a few tenths of a percentage point.
At the moment, we are mainly subsidising more greenhouse gas emissions.
The People's Republic of China itself has helped the Taiwanese authorities, and this is a gesture that I consider to be very significant.
On the other hand, culture has of course a dual nature.
There are currently significant differences, and these are an obstacle to business people who wish to expand into the markets of those other Member States where the standards are higher.
The report calls for the following aspects to be clarified in the future evaluations carried out by the European Commission and the Court of Auditors of the European Union: whether the funds allocated by the European Union were used to ensure safe decommissioning; whether decommissioning guarantees the safe storage of nuclear waste; whether there was sufficient coordination between the three existing programmes so that the experience accumulated was used effectively and the model was followed, based on projects prepared and funded previously in order to achieve a reduction in costs; whether the current plans and strategies are complete or whether it is still possible to add new activities and provide additional funds later on; whether additional sums still need to be allocated to energy projects or whether attention needs to be focused on decommissioning projects; and whether financing for these activities still needs to be provided from EU funds.
Are our countries able and willing politically to accept the ultimate consequences - of using force, if necessary - and do we have the ability to act in this way?
In accordance with paragraph 42 of the Interinstitutional Agreement, no operational appropriations for the Common Foreign and Security Policy may appear in the Council's budget.
The credibility of the EU legal system, and consequently of the European Union, depends on it.
The amendments that I and my fellow Members proposed, and which were approved by a large majority in the Committee on Regional Development, will allow the old Member States, and not only the new ones, as the original draft proposed, to be able to benefit as well from this possibility of financing.
(Applause)
Additional control of the credit rating agencies, for example, should, therefore, if and when it is judged necessary, be initiated and planned at the global level.
This exposes the double standards of many countries in the European Union, who rightly demand that candidate states uphold human rights, but themselves trample on human rights within the European Union.
I am thinking particularly of the huge amount of energy recovery work required in existing building stock, such as social housing, where energy renovation (which would help families to cut their utility bills) will require a significant financial commitment by local authorities.
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Samecki, 2010 is the International Year of Biodiversity and the EU is about to press ahead with a new strategy for biodiversity, in other words, for the protection of flora and fauna within the area of the European Union.
I would like to stress the major importance of a comprehensive approach to be adopted for the risk classification, which includes possible risks related not only to the nature of the incoming material, in this case breadcrumbs, but also to the process itself.
The current level of funding is sufficient.
On Amendment 7 the multiannual framework is designed to regulate obligations on European Institutions and/or the Member States to monitor compliance with all international human rights conventions to which the Member States are party.
International law has to be respected.
This is also the case within the Council of Europe and within the wider UN framework.
This readmission agreement is therefore a necessary complement to the adoption of the visa facilitation agreement reached with Georgia, which would necessarily have to be accompanied by an improvement in the security conditions necessary to combat cross-border crime and illegal immigration.
- (PL) Madam President, I congratulate Mr Mauro.
Neurodegenerative diseases pose a major health problem in Europe.
Why is this happening?
(FR) Madam President, I would like to say one more thing by pointing out that the explanatory statement drawn up by the rapporteur contains remarks that are completely off the subject and out of context with the theme being dealt with in this report.
Speaking of Estonia, I think that this directive will bring to an end the situation in which our lorries pay in other countries, while vehicles from other countries do not pay to drive on our roads.
We welcome the move for equal rights for all groups of migrants here because we have been concerned that looking at this in a sectoral approach can lead to even greater complexity in terms of different rights for different workers.

In addition, it underscores the need to redouble efforts to put an end to the armed groups' activity, and to hold to account those responsible for human rights violations.

As far as our group is concerned, this report conveys an ambition for European agriculture.
What knowledge do you, with the greatest respect, have on EPAs?
Like the Air Safety Agreement with the US, the key objectives set out in the negotiations were to minimise the duplication of assessments, tests and controls and enable both the EU and Canada to rely on each other's certification systems.
In the opinion of many observers, these problems have increased.
On the other hand, the values proposed by the Council mirror the austerity of budgets adopted at a national level within the EU.

It allows titles published in four countries to be scanned and made available against payment.

I have been closely monitoring the debates at national governmental and parliamentary level and in the media
The best Soviet rockets were built in Ukraine.
That is why the European Parliament is right to send a clear signal to the Chinese people today, indicating that the Members of this House stand shoulder to shoulder with them, that we understand their suffering and want to help.

His draft Treaty establishing the European Union, which the European Parliament adopted by a substantial majority in 1984, created the basis for many of the important changes introduced by subsequent Treaty reforms, including a substantial expansion of the European Parliament's legislative powers.

The German conservative group (CDU/CSU) is therefore speaking out in favour of a social Europe.
In some countries, such as Spain, in the banking sector, the regional banks (cajas) in particular are in difficulty, and here, life-support from the European Central Bank is needed - although the ECB, as Mr Lamberts pointed out in 30 seconds, risks having many bad assets.
In the economic recovery plan approved by the Commission and endorsed by the Council, we propose that, between now and 2010, an additional EUR 4 billion from unused Community budget resources be mobilised for trans-European energy networks and related investments.

I am thinking particularly of Singapore, a country with a prosperous and modern economy, whose population benefits from all the advantages of a developed country except political freedoms, and more specifically, freedom of expression and assembly.
I think that the European Union and its Member States must define and implement a principle of 'climate justice' and, therefore, introduce an equity clause in future international climate negotiations.
Some newspaper headlines today read 'Europe puts Italy on trial' or 'Comrade Schulz, Berlusconi's enemy, against Italy'.
Is this to say it is impossible to act on the causes?
It even goes into the infrastructure for connections to airports.
I do not need to underline that; as you know, equality between men and women is one of the fundamental values of the European Union, and you can count on the unfailing commitment of the Commission in this area.
Beyond these unpleasant facts, and the feeling among Bulgarians is that their institutions are not working properly and that human rights are being brutally undermined.

on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, this question, as explained by Mr Blokland, is very timely, given the diplomatic conference on the convention for the recycling of ships, to be held in May.
We do not seem to be able to learn from past mistakes.

Why, yet again, given the failure of the first round of bank bail-outs, are taxpayers being expected to come forward and rescue some very wealthy individuals from the consequences of their own error?

With regard to Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs, I would like to support the amendment submitted by the European Socialist Group, in which the competent bodies are allowed to exempt economic agents in the foods sector from the implementation of one or several of the imposed measures, provided that these bodies are capable of proving that there is no risk that must be avoided, or that all identified risks are sufficiently and regularly controlled by means of application of the general and special requirements of hygiene of foodstuffs.
I also agree that:
Overall it will help to protect the environment from climate change.
Today, we can welcome the major advances in efficiency offered by the proposal that we have before us.
Now, when I saw today that the vote on this proposal would not be held tomorrow as originally scheduled but postponed indefinitely, although the debate is obviously still going on, I smelled a rat because votes usually follow debates very closely.
Written statements (Rule 149)
You have probably read a recent interview given by one of my predecessors, Mr Delors, who said that his proposal of reinforced coordination on social matters failed in 1993.
The latter would counteract the madness that sometimes characterises those who take decisions on the basis of purely financial considerations.
Tomorrow we will find out the positions of all the political groups, and also the various national delegations and individual Members.
Arrests, torture and executions of minors and women have increased.
We do raise these issues directly as well; it is really important that we all stand together in pushing forward on human rights in Iran.
I think we should reflect carefully before we do that again.
I would urge, given that we are concentrating so much on the need for recovery in Europe and the need to deal with the crisis we find ourselves in - which, of course, must be at the top of our domestic agenda - that we do not lose sight of the fact that 11 million children are dying each year in the developing world, five million of them because they do not have medicines we have had for 30 years.
The immediate ending of the conspicuous discrimination against non-Islamic minorities when filling important civilian and military posts within the Turkish Government apparatus.

It is right to establish regulations regarding the characteristics required in order for a section of railway to achieve categorisation as a European corridor, because this will help the state and regional authorities to plan, coordinate, and understand each other.
Yet we see that both Iceland and the Faroe Islands have caught 150 000 tonnes each and this is impacting directly on the sustainability of European fishing fleets.
Commemoration of deportations in 1941 in the Baltic States

President of the European Commission. - I fully agree with you, Mr Marinescu.

Thank you for your point.
I thank you, too, for the clear declaration - from a state like Slovenia, a state with your country's history - that you see it as an opportunity for the freedom of your people, because by it you are also sending out a signal against the far right in Europe, which abuses every one of these freedoms with its rhetoric of fear against Europe and makes people afraid of any imponderable developments instead of reassuring them of the opportunities that freedom brings.

I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution on a revised Framework Agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission for the next parliamentary term as it is an important agreement, not only for its symbolic value - given that it gives a clear signal of the commitment of both European institutions, Parliament and the Commission, to work together in pursuit of the European project - but also because of its content, since it identifies the obligations of the parties so that they can better confront the challenges of the future and resolve the problems of the citizenry.

(ES) Mr President, I voted in favour of this initiative in order to condemn the mass human rights violations and the use of rape as a weapon of war against women, boys, girls and babies; in order to ask for those implicated to be held responsible; in order to demand more commitment from the United Nations following the failure of the actions of the United Nations Organisation Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; in order to demand a political solution to the armed conflict, which needs to happen by resuming the dialogue on the peace process; and in order to demand greater commitment from the Great Lakes region to promoting peace and stability in the region.
In light of how much the pound has dropped, I do not even want to imagine what the value of the peseta would be today if we still had that in our wallets.
Despite all the discussions - and particularly in the United Kingdom you have a huge discussion on this with East Anglia and, although the IPCC should be better at correcting errors when they find them - to this day, I have seen nothing that really goes against the main finding of science, namely that we have to address this issue and we have to be serious about it.
I therefore voted in favour of Mr Sterckx's report on establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system, since this system fits into a wider context aimed at improving the safety of maritime traffic and making it easier to manage, something which I have already endorsed on many occasions.
With the Treaty of Lisbon, we will be stronger in the future and we will be better able to act.
Encouraging many of these countries to make their agricultural economies dependent on the EU is an attempt to bind these countries to an agreement that imposes on them an agricultural model based on monoculture for export, resulting in obvious and serious economic, social and environmental problems for both the people of many African countries and for the people of the EU Member States.

The fact that the system works is proof that the market, competition and environmental protection are not mutually exclusive ideas.

The Commission is grateful to the European Parliament for its persistent efforts to combat discrimination.
Member States must make full use of this opportunity to complement their efforts to ensure the effective social inclusion of the most vulnerable and the European Commission should come forward with a specific action plan on this Regulation to speed up the use of funds and to prepare a report on their utilisation.

However, we are working on this and we hope that it will be implemented soon.
I admit I am often taken aback by some of the views expressed, but then that is what we are here for.

The fact that we will have a European regulator to help each Member State's enterprises to be treated on an equal basis in the other 26 Member States and that the energy suppliers on the other 26 markets will have new opportunities is an important aspect of this regulation, resulting in the creation of completely new opportunities.

President Barroso, you said just now that Member States are achieving less than half what they set out to achieve on the 20% target for energy saving by 2020, so why is the Commission not pushing hard to make that target binding on Member States?
I am very pleased that today's plenary session has eliminated some serious shortcomings from the proposed regulation on harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products, which were inserted into this technical standard by the socialist rapporteur.
Torture is used.

I hope the outcome will be a value-oriented Europe of citizens of which we can be proud!

Given that the following months are crucial to the European Union's budgetary policy and that, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, budgetary transfers or reviews will follow up until the start of 2010, a clear-cut procedure must be established for this transitional period to facilitate the implementation of the budget and the adoption of amending budgets.

I would also encourage Euromed to make it clear that the Blue Card for the regulation of qualified immigrants is not a threat to Europeans; on the contrary, it is an opportunity offered to us by globalisation.

As you know, the CE mark was not created at the time as a source of consumer information.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe it is right that our Parliament should send the family of Mrs Reggiani a message of condolence.

Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution, and there are at least two important issues in the document I would like to clarify my position on.
The last thing I absolutely have to mention is that the UK, which had initially decided not to be involved in the adoption of the regulation following its reservations about the Rome Convention, has now apparently decided to take part after all, in the light of the wording produced by the negotiations.
What we are debating here is nothing other than extending the working hours of self-employed workers.
It is an important agreement for the EU and our aviation sector.
How could we have got into such a situation?
The Commission recommendation on the active inclusion of people excluded from the labour market and the EPSCO Council Conclusions of 17 December 2008 on common active inclusion principles to combat poverty more effectively both highlight the importance of access to adequate resources, alongside quality services and inclusive labour markets.
I should like to offer my congratulations on the excellent work carried out by Mr Callanan.
in writing. - (IT) The world has tolerated China's bullying of the Tibetan people and culture for decades, for reasons of geopolitical opportunism.
The crisis has dramatically reversed the favourable conditions in which the economic and financial sector operated until 2007, and the majority of Member States need to undergo a process of consolidating their accounts to reduce public debt.
I agree with this proposal, for which I voted, but I think that catch control needs to be scientifically monitored, navigation control systems need to be modernised and wrecks need to be cleaned.
All this, as you said Baroness Ashton, can happen if we are able to make proactive contributions of two kinds: firstly, a diplomatic contribution, but also - as you stated, High Representative - a substantial and material contribution.
Now I should like to ask the Commission and the Council what action they will take to make that moratorium more general and support a general ban.
One of the prerequisites for the functioning of democracy is participation.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are discussing three measures relating to the health and protection of consumers, which we have already voted in favour of in committee and which we will vote in favour of in plenary.
The European External Action Service (EEAS) is now well set to become an operational diplomatic corps.
When Commissioner Dimas had his preliminary interview with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we also raised this problem with him.
This position should not be understood as a denial of the policy of Community competence as a legal basis for the legislation, but as an upgrading of the requirements of the ordinary procedure in this sphere, to meet the higher values recognised in the Treaty.
(FI) Mr President, I voted in favour of this proposal, which is a very worthy one, as it concerns whether we should fund parties using taxpayers' money.
It is clearly a loophole if a nominal joint account enables evasion of attachment orders, but genuine third party funds must be protected.
All of this is fully in keeping with the goals set out in the Lisbon strategy launched by the European institutions at the dawn of the new millennium.
It is hardly surprising, therefore, that the citizens are losing patience with the policies of the European Union.
Sorry, but we will have the explanation of vote from Mr Helmer.
We therefore believe that, based on this consideration, we should commit to a transitional security system that will enable the gradual demilitarisation of all security in the world.
We must therefore fight this counterfeiting.
Moreover, in spite of the 2007 Commission Communication entitled Black Sea Synergy - A new regional cooperation initiative, measures were taken soon after that time with a view to implementing an effective strategy for the future of the Black Sea.
I had heard nothing about it until literally this week and suddenly I get deluged with approaches, both from the IASCF and from the Commission, trying to persuade me one way or the other as to whether the IMF should be included in the monitoring group.
The public authorities in Tunisia have the capacity to provide the people with a package of basic services, services that other countries in the region have not yet been able to implement, and I believe that it is important to point this out, too.
In this regard - as you have proposed - we must enter into negotiations with the Council Presidency as soon as possible in order to agree a number of amendments.
Better air conditioning, better roads and a change in driver behaviour - in other words, all of us.
There was agreement that we should continue with the holistic approach to the pension reforms.
We need to think about whether Europe's innovation policy even has a future, if regional policy does not support it.
Moreover, the number of complaints will doubtless continue to grow with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the incomplete or delayed implementation of European legislation by Member States.
I would like to know whether this is true, and whether the representatives of large companies will take part in negotiations on the Russian side.
Obliging EU states to allow asylum seekers to work after six months, if their claim is not decided, is very important: they would retain dignity and also pay tax.
The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on the 5th World Water Forum in Istanbul, 16-22 March 2009, by Mr Borrell Fontelles, on behalf of the Committee on Development - B6-0015/2009).
It enables a State, when asked, to provide help through its special units.
By way of example, I would like to recall the 2006 infringement proceedings on radio spectrum allocation in Italy, which my colleague Neelie Kroes and I opened.
Although we are now thinking about and debating the next multiannual framework, it was important to reiterate the fact that cohesion policy remains an essential lever for growth and that the budget earmarked for it should not be reduced.
The climate energy package has important symbolic value, as it illustrates the fact that the representatives of half a billion citizens, 500 million people, have managed to agree on some very clear-cut actions, strategies and aims in this important and sensitive agenda despite today's difficult economic circumstances.
Both are, therefore, very good reports.
The European Union should make use of its diplomatic tools - Mrs FerreroWaldner, please say this to President Barroso - we must meet with the Dalai Lama and do him the honour of allowing him to speak, in order to find the truth.
Thank you.
On the other hand, what is very clear, and what is documented in all kinds of impact studies that have already been done by the way by the Commission, on all kinds of items, is that a lot of our jobs are linked to intellectual property rights and that is one of the reasons we attach such importance to that topic.
Expanding trade is a common interest for Europe and Ukraine, but there is a need for undistorted trade that also ensures the application by Ukraine of the social, employment, animal health, plant health and environmental rules. Failing this, we will have to face many problems.
For that support to be effective, we need to strengthen our common foreign and security policy and make the EU election observation missions more efficient.
Personally, apart from support for the diversification of transport routes for the import of gas, I consider the appeal to expedite the achievement of internal market energy in the current legislature and the necessity to revisit the entire problem of gas storage as major contributions of the report.
Environmental economic accounts should contribute to policy evaluation, particularly by making data available on the environmental impact of economic activities.
One point that I think we need to stress more is education.
Transport is a very wide area.
We need a European solidarity and cohesion policy, backed up with specific legislative, fiscal and financial measures.
I would like to call on Commissioner Barnier, who promised us that the Commission would take a more energetic approach, to adopt measures to improve this situation.
This specific legislation organises the working time of persons performing mobile road activities, such as bus drivers and lorry drivers.
So this is also a democratic task and mission for all of us.
For Lithuania it spells another sequential step towards deeper European integration.
If universities are able to submit projects to meet the requirements of the lifelong learning programme during the 2007-2013 period, the European Commission is prepared to finance these projects as well.
I would suggest that farmers in Ireland will now be more supportive of the Lisbon Treaty because they fear that Member States will have more control over agriculture policy and they know the dangers of that from our budget for 2009 when the Irish Government slashed support for agriculture: they trust Europe more than their Member State.
I support the idea expressed in this report about the need to channel the resources towards those measures aimed at achieving the Europe 2020 strategy objectives.
(For the results and other details on the vote: see Minutes)
Let me make three brief points in response.
The second matter is about the Union.
I therefore think that we can cooperate as closely as possible within the framework of the new legal basis.
Energy-hungry emerging economies and wasteful industrial countries were not even prepared to implement the Kyoto Protocol.
Establishing the G20 was the brainchild of President Sarkozy, who believes that nowadays, the global economy is no longer regulated by the 8, but by all the major developing countries, too.
There has been a further decline in employment in European Union Member States and it is forecast that this will continue.
We are in agreement on that.
It is different from the President of the Commission, who was selected by the Heads of State or Government and elected by this Parliament.
The final version of the draft agenda for this sitting, as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 30 April 2009, pursuant to Rule 132 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed.
The second type of measure relates to increasing grants for student exchange.
I am calling on the Commission to require that the relevant law should be upheld in all Member States and to do all it can to ensure that it is implemented.
Madam President, before we criticise Russia for human rights abuses, we should look at similar abuses even within the European Union: countries in which opposition parties are physically attacked, such as Hungary, or attacked by the militia of the ruling party, such as even the United Kingdom, or countries that lock people up for non-violent dissent or ban political parties, like Belgium.
The situation on the ground is dreadful.
However, in all our attempts to improve the internal market, we must not forget the numerous imports from third countries.
However, I also have concerns about the current position of some EU heads of government.
Written Statements (Rule 149)
It is high time!
I voted for this report and, in particular, for its provisions that follow on from the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December 2009.
It seems legitimate that the future financial agenda - the 2020 strategy - should provide resources which will help this type of development in the Member States.
Thus we need to attract investment, but at the same time improve all EU programmes which could support this highly important sector, and try to overcome the gap between research and application which is characteristic of many productive sectors in the European Union.
Giving women that power means that when children are born, they are wanted and are genuinely able to develop - something that is every child's basic right.
We would all like to achieve the same result, but at this stage we have not yet found the compromise that suits and brings all the potential together to resolve this issue.
That said, the end result that we have is an open and reasonably balanced one.
The terrorist threat will therefore never succeed in bringing democracy to its knees!
- After the vote on recital J
I call on you to be responsible.
First of all, this resolution allows us to further improve the content of our annual reports on competition policy and secondly, and more importantly, it will serve as the basis for the Commission to engage in detailed dialogue with Parliament.
On the one hand, there is a constant attempt to hide the true situation in Europe.
(Loud applause)
I should like to thank Parliament for the support we have obtained over recent years, for the good cooperation that I have always enjoyed from you, the representatives of the citizens of the European Union.
The restructuring plan for these shipyards is forever being rejected, which is bound to result in them collapsing, instead of helping the European shipbuilding industry to regain its place in the world.
Single European Sky (debate)
This motion for a resolution of the European Parliament on implementation of the guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States rests on a number of pillars, of which I would highlight: the current economic crisis, which is increasing unemployment and social exclusion; the need to create synergies that encourage development with a view to pursuing the objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy; and the Commission's proposal that, under the terms of the Annual Growth Survey, the same employment policy guidelines should be adopted for 2011 as for 2010.
It lasted two years. Now I buy a new microwave every year - the cheapest I can find - and it is then thrown away.
Governments also give priority to good relations with their colleagues in dictatorial states, instead of bringing pressure to bear in order to improve the situation there.
The other aspects of the Commission's proposal are very technical, with many details related to the construction and use of fishing gears in the Atlantic.
We cannot agree that the Amsterdam test would involve an unjustifiable administrative burden.
May I remind you of the thought to be found in the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, that one condition for effective soil protection is the maintenance and development of agriculture. Soil nurtured by farmers retains its fertility, but when it is deprived of this care it turns into a desert.
We had differing opinions, we still have differing opinions, and that is why we should not come back to it to try and arrive at a new resolution.
I understand that a reform of the wine market is necessary.
The financial aid released through the fund will enable the Portuguese authorities, particularly the regional government of Madeira, to recover part of the expenses they incurred in responding to the emergency.
Who is next, Spain, Portugal, Italy or Ireland?
The basic objective is to eliminate the pay gap between the two sexes and the equalities caused by it and to take measures to support working single mothers by making working times more flexible.
The next item is the report by Mr Parish, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes - C6-0391/2008 -.
This approach was at least proposed, and when we received the report it was not yet clear when the Treaty would materialise.
Aspects of family law, including civil status, reproductive rights and adoption rights must not be included as part of the scope of application of the proposal for a directive, a fact which must doubtlessly be made clear from the legislative text.
Rise in food prices (vote)
It is incomprehensible that the Commission intends to switch the allocation of funds from a regional to a national basis, or even at European level, rejecting the criterion of proximity that has always underpinned cohesion policy.
The case must be diverted away from the UN Security Council and back to the International Atomic Energy Agency.
At a time when the Iberian peninsula holds two important presidencies (the Council of the European Union via the Spanish Prime Minister, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, and the European Commission via Portugal's José Manuel Barroso), I regret that the Spanish Presidency has not demonstrated its capacity to bring added political value to relations with the continent of America outside the United States and Canada.
If the EU is mentioned it may be some small aside, but nothing much more than that.
Mr Swoboda, it can be done.
I also consider it very important to support lifelong learning and activities that are not just for young people.
A renewed increase in the euro-area aggregate fiscal deficit ratio is projected for 2008.
Nevertheless, time is still spent debating whether we are a hundred per cent certain that humans are causing climate change or not.
It provides an insight into the effects of sector-based Community and decentralised activity such as research and development, the common agricultural policy, traffic and transport, the job situation and countering climate change.
Naturally, I defer to the wishes of Parliament, after having sought to explain the reasons why I have brought this possibility to the attention of Parliament.
The European Union's Generalised System of Preferences (vote)
Nevertheless, the Commission works with Member States to foster mutual learning and exchanges of good practice.
A very important point of concern for smaller enterprises is the administrative burden, most of which is brought to bear by national and decentralised governments.
I cannot agree with the World Trade talks in Geneva.
This status is necessary for convergence in relation to the budget and the organisation of the political parties at European level and their foundations.
It can only be considered an alternative to fossil fuels, however, if we can produce it from renewable energy sources at a competitive price, without emitting carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere in the process.
Any suspension would lead to passengers and airlines from the Union experiencing significant losses to the benefits that they have enjoyed since March 2008.
The second priority is the implementation of the Pact on Immigration and Asylum.
One of the recurring criticisms by Member States of the proposed recast of procedures is that it will lead to an unnecessary financial burden on them, but there is a significant body of evidence - and I pay tribute to what the Commission said on the Solihull project in the United Kingdom - that front-loading asylum procedures leads to better decisions at first instance; quality decision making is a key element which we must not miss.
We can only overcome the present financial crisis through joint efforts, which is why we need to unite and work together on this common initiative.

on behalf of the UEN Group. - Madam President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office and the Commissioner, as well as my colleagues, for their comments so far.
I would like to propose that this period be expanded in order to maximise many economic, safety and environmental benefits which are associated with the summer time period.
This is the biggest crisis that you have ever had, and I am telling you now that this is serious.
The crisis is a structural one, and has not been caused merely by current circumstances, as you have said, but by the successive deregulations.
Also, all Members who have a financial interest in the alcohol industry should declare an interest.
Furthermore, in these conclusions, Council agreed to urgently develop the strengthened medium- and long-term measures relating inter alia to transparency regarding the physical flow of gas, demand and storage volumes, regional or bilateral solidarity arrangements, to address the issue of missing energy infrastructure interconnections (which is a huge problem), to continue to diversify the transport route and sources, and to address the financing aspects of this, also by speeding up the revision of the Security of Gas Supply Directive.
Everyone knows that we pursue a policy of double standards.
It is important to understand the past and the causes of the crisis, and I think the Union has done its homework on that, but today, the focus must be on the future.
But will European society be healthier for smoking tobacco of clearly inferior quality imported from third countries?
We also strongly oppose references to the Lisbon Treaty, in particular those which suggest that the competences of the European Union in the field of climate change are not already sufficient.
Member States must finally abandon the negotiation of bilateral readmission agreements with Kosovo, which are leading to Roma being returned to lead-contaminated camps in northern Mitrovica, as Mr Hammarberg, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, has been able to demonstrate.
Firstly, a balance must be maintained between children's security and data protection.
This requires the creation of the right technical, practical and economic conditions.
Moves to strengthen and improve the existing legal provisions are to be encouraged, especially as regards the transparency of air fares.
I think that is the consensus between the finance ministers and, by the way, that was also the position that the European Union brought to the G20.
This is reflected in the lower salaries for women, the smaller number of women who work when they have dependants, as well as in the sharing of responsibility between men and women in family life.
(PL) Mr President, Mrs Ashton, I would like to ask Mrs Ashton a somewhat indiscreet question.
First and foremost, we must concentrate on dealing with fisheries infringements within the Union.
After all, transport is responsible for 30% of CO2 emissions, which is why I am pleased to see that it has been accepted that transport should be included in the central demands of the Europe 2020 strategy.
On the Roma community - I believe that the Presidency has responded on this - I should like to point out in fact that we organised the Roma Summit on 16 September.
It will also establish the obligation to pay default interest for late payment These are rules based on absolute justice, and they can help to alleviate the situation of many companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
Faced with this crisis and this price fall, it goes without saying that Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development wishes to find out from the Commission what we can do right now and in the future to escape this crisis and, above all, what measures could be adopted in the coming months to support farmers and to ensure that the agricultural markets are less volatile.
The general principles of the European Union's policy towards third countries concerning the death penalty, adopted in 1998 and reviewed in 2008, set out the criteria for issuing demarches and define the standards that should be used.
That is why the Commission hopes to encourage international cooperation in this area and will be organising a meeting this year with international organisations and EU agencies to try to coordinate the respective activities of these bodies.
But leaving that political difference aside, I - happily - am not a Conservative, therefore I do not have to vote blindly for complete nonsense.
The solutions which will be reached must ensure the State of Israel of its continued existence in the region and provide the Palestinians with the guarantee that they will be able to live with dignity in their own viable, democratic and independent state.
They are not ready now, and they never will be.
I, too, would like to make a personal comment.
My special thanks go to Mrs Creţu who drafted the opinion on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality.
I would also like to point out here that if we suppress or attempt to suppress this programme we would send out a very bad signal at this very delicate moment in time, when many Europeans do not have enough to eat.
The European Parliament has adopted the Council's position of 10 December 2010 on the draft general budget which was presented by the Commission on 26 November 2010.
I feel that the European Union and NATO must cooperate with each other, avoiding any potential rivalry.
It is a directive that introduces rigorous limits on the use of 33 substances, notably insecticides, chemical and industrial substances and heavy metals.
It must be the other way round.
It is also worth pointing out that this measure does not represent increased risks in terms of illegal immigration and public security, while the Taiwanese government's commitment to extend the exemption of visas to all 27 Member States by the end of 2010 should also be emphasised.
The European Union telecoms legislative framework arose in the 1990s, and was intended to liberalise domestic markets dominated by state monopolies.
I would also like to underline that we need a policy on flounders and flatfish, as we have already said.
The Bulgaria-Turkey-Greece area is one of the most sensitive parts of the European Union's external borders in terms of illegal migration.
We have also sought coherence there with access to jobs.
In spite of the lack of agreement with the Member States on the proposal for a directive, we have persisted, and will continue to do so.
The report seeks to provide a framework highlighting the integrating role of cohesion policy and the contribution it makes to increasing the EU's global competitiveness.
I think that we have to take action, that we cannot leave everything as it is.
I hope that this report will send a clear message about integrating gender equality as part of achieving a fair pension system.
That is another blow!
Therefore, as rapporteur, I drew up another draft report, modifying the legal basis.

For this reason, the coming 2010 review conference between the parties to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty is of particular importance.
What will prove possible, however, depends on the Croatian Government and the cooperation between it, that is the ruling coalition, and the opposition in the Croatian Parliament.
Mr President, in the current economic climate, I think it is crucial that we do everything in our power to support those members of society who wish to contribute to our economy.
It is therefore also fitting for the motion for a resolution to highlight the case of Mumia Abu-Jamal as one of the specific cases on which to focus in the coming period, among other things, by representatives of the EU taking up the case with the US authorities, the US administration and, of course, the US President too.
In various parts the Busuttil report urges the Commission to take action.
At the same time, there has been the transfer of certain amounts towards the modernisation of a region.
Lastly, I should like to voice my support for two powerful ideas upheld by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats): the power conferred on the European Commission to adopt delegated acts should be reviewed every five years, and a verification clause should be introduced - the verification clause being the second powerful idea in this regulation.

For that reason, it would also have been good if Mrs Cruz had been present.
(The order of business was thus established)
If it further promotes fishing as a viable industry for the small and medium operator, especially family-owned fishing boats, then I certainly can support it, because, as it is, fishing is dangerous and in many parts of the world exploitive - not just of fish, but also of people.
Forwarding of texts adopted during the sitting: see Minutes
In view of this, I decided to endorse his candidacy.
And this too merits greater support on our part.

As the EU, we should support the Arab countries in the peaceful pursuit of reforms.
3.
We will carefully examine the recommendations of the Barnier Report when the proposals are submitted.
A potential market of hundreds of billions of euros.
That is the only way of building the confidence required for accession.
Nevertheless, I urge you: this must remain within the confines of common sense, with no consideration for the populism of certain elements of the gutter press that seems to devote itself to earning money through its populist exaggerations of serious topics in the European Union.
We do not have sufficient nurseries and crèches.
Christian nurses have been disciplined for offering to pray with patients and, only today, Lillian Ladele, a Christian registrar who was told to perform civil partnerships or face dismissal, has lost her case for religious discrimination at the Court of Appeal in the United Kingdom.
I would also like to call on the Commission to concentrate more, when performing impact assessments, on the transparency of the entire assessment process, to strive harder for its independence, and not to aim for just one solution to a problem in its proposals, but to assess multiple variant solutions to a specific situation independently.
The economic crisis has taught us that strict auditing and oversight are indispensible.
This is why we are voting today and weighing up whether what you are saying is convincing.

As already mentioned by the Minister, the European Union established a two-tier framework to support the closure of Guantánamo, firstly through the Justice and Home Affairs Council conclusion of 4 June 2009 and the annexed information exchange mechanism and, secondly, through the Joint Statement of the European Union and its Member States and the United States of America on the Closure of the Guantánamo Bay Detention Facility and Future Counter-Terrorism Cooperation of 15 June 2009.

This is the right step in the right direction.
Basically, no country has ever achieved 100% utilisation of structural funds, and priorities shift over time.
This is why I am fighting for better labelling of food imitations in the Regulation on the labelling of foodstuffs, for example.

Implementing a framework agreement designed to promote cooperation in the fight against illegal immigration and aiming, at the same time, at political dialogue based on human rights, is one of the priorities for the Union's Mediterranean policy.
Is it a new earthquake, does it have a different cause? I repeat once again, taking as my starting point the last fatal earthquake and the victims you referred to and - I would add - the consequential cultural damage and destruction, that we should highlight the European dimension of this phenomenon.
The truth is that, in this case as well, the absence of restrictions that was demanded with regard to suppliers and services provided - for operations between countries, within each country, and even outside the EU and Canadian markets, as provided for by the Agreement - and to limitations on state intervention in airlines will contribute to the objective of opening the way to monopolistic concentration within the sector...
Not just the Hamas militants who triggered the military conflict, but innocent children, women and men.

6.
This is the place.
When the groups were debating whether or not to in fact table today's resolution, the overriding opinion was initially one of scepticism; when questioned, most Members admitted to having no idea as to what Holodomor actually means and what it stands for.
There are already EU licences for small music publishers. While these efforts are ongoing, we should not legislate prematurely.
I suggest that we produce an own-initiative report on the actual administrative costs of the European Union here in the Committee on Budgetary Control.
Further proposals are expected in the coming weeks.
Thanks to the efficient work of the rapporteur, Ms Weber, it has been possible to identify a compromise on simplified reporting and documentation requirements, in the case of mergers and divisions of public limited liability companies which will maintain a very significant part of the savings potential of the original Commission proposal, which amounts to EUR 172 million per year.
There should also be a ban on consumers using this substance, because they do not generally have the necessary personal protective equipment and cannot be trained or supervised to ensure that they use the substance safely.
We have every confidence that this process can be restored in 2011 after overcoming minor difficulties.

Many of our western socialist and liberal colleagues are siding with a party of ex-communists and pseudo-liberals against the true force behind the change of regime, the followers of the late József Antall, the freedom fighters of Viktor Orbán.
Very well, I should like to say that the diplomatic and consular missions of the Member States and the Commission delegations in third countries cooperate to ensure that the common positions and joint actions adopted by the Council in the context of the common foreign and security policy are observed and implemented as specified in the Treaty on European Union.
I do not wish to impose anything on anyone: I just want to assess possibilities.
Furthermore, I must say that the European Union is and will remain an important supporter of the work of the United Nations, concerning both the ongoing reform of the institutional mechanisms and the creation of this gender entity within the United Nations.
Instead of removing micro-entities from the fourth directive entirely, a diminished requirement for regulation should be clearly determined and established within the framework of the planned revision of the fourth and seventh directives.

We want a social pact to replace the Lisbon strategy and the Stability Pact.
(The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m.)

in writing. - (PL) In the course of the roll-call vote and in connection with Amendment 48, I voted against infringement of equal rights for competing entities by singling out three European Union countries and granting them a privileged position on the market.

The conservationists are right up there with national leaders and a long line of experts, company directors and investors.
What is worse, however, is that counterfeit foodstuffs, car parts, cosmetics, toys and especially medicines, also pose a real threat to the health and lives of consumers.

We should try to use it here too, because I think, from what people have said, that a number of subjects have emerged that are clearly a priority.
We have just established a special committee in Parliament which will discuss what the European Union Cohesion and Structural Funds will look like in future and we should not prejudge this committee's work.
First of all, it is absolutely vital that we take action promptly to prevent global warming, which is said to be faster than predicted.

Furthermore, I support the drawing up of a European strategy for combating natural disasters and for strengthening a joint European force ready to respond in the event of a disaster, in any corner of the EU.
The EU has swamped the United Kingdom with extra workers.
All European regions will be affected by those new challenges, but their impact will vary significantly across Europe, often resulting in losses of competitiveness, employment and social cohesion.
The Member States should give credit to their work by regarding, as far as possible, time spent caring for relatives as a period of employment, and providing social guarantees.
Ladies and gentlemen, a compromise has been reached between the Council and our institution, thus making it possible to conclude this matter at second reading.
I think we should take Mrs Balzani's approach very seriously.

This process has by no means finished.
One noticeable disappearance is that of an insurance policy, by means of a financial guarantee, that would make it easier for the victims of maritime disasters to be compensated.

I would like to finish by thanking all the technical staff, whose work has enabled us to obtain an agreement which, at the very beginning of the negotiations, we at times lost faith in reaching.

I therefore ask the Commissioner what action she intends to take, in view of the fact that the fundamental rights in the new Hungarian constitution are hardly compatible with those of the European Union and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
I also think that it is time to conclude the 20 years of negotiations by signing the Free Trade Agreement, which would be so beneficial to both sides.

Parliament's position, which is necessary for talks with the EU Council, will be formulated on the basis of these priorities.
As far as the protection of minors from the harmful effects of public information is concerned, the European Parliament, too, decided recently that the various types of advertising that have been spreading via the new communications media in recent years have become a social phenomenon.

Partnership is vital but it also costs money.
I voted in favour of this report on the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste to send a clear message to the Member States: polluters must be held responsible for their waste.
It is time to prioritise social sustainability.

Will the agreement reached on 16 November between the EU and Russia on an early warning system and the draft regulation on the security of gas supply, which I welcome, be enough?

It is ridiculous to believe that savings can be made in this area.
At the same time, none of this will affect market competition conditions.
Whether further macro-regions should follow depends on how these first two perform and whether other proposals are made to demonstrate a specific added value that goes beyond existing cooperation, and if they really meet the clear needs that cannot be fulfilled through other means.
The negotiations are regarded as 'a long-lasting and open-ended process'.
All the European institutions that depend on the European Union budget have to be thoroughly audited by the Court of Auditors and by all entities with that function.
That is a tragedy.
So when I have constituents in London and cheesemongers complaining to me about the fact that they have had to invest lots of money to make sure, for example, that the facilities they use to sell cheese meet EU standards that have been gold plated by British civil servants, and then they travel across to other Member States and see cheese being sold openly in street markets and melting and they wonder about the application of Community laws in other countries, it is time for us to show that we are strict about application of Community law right across the EU.
In that case, may I simply add - given that you granted a little more time to someone else, I thought I could allow myself a few seconds more, Mr President, since I am also a chairman - that these institutions have a duty to take steps to improve these instruments of democracy and participation, because we also have the Treaty of Lisbon, which introduces the right of popular initiative.
The magic word in all these measures is inclusion - the inclusion of civil society, social dialogue and the active application of the horizontal social clause in accordance with the principles of the social market economy.
We need to do this firstly because, at the European Council last March, the Heads of State and Government adopted the best possible strategy for enabling the European Union to address globalisation and the challenges of energy supply and climate change.

Where does the integration of social and social sustainability objectives with macro-economic policy stop?

There have so far been neither safeguards nor guarantees and these have yet to appear.
However, this crisis has highlighted that the European system is not infallible and that we are extremely vulnerable.

Despite the fact that the polluter pays principle, one of the pillars of the European Union's environmental policy, is in force throughout the Community, its application in certain countries leaves much to be desired.
There were several points of divergence.
We need a major change of course and this calls for an act of considerable humility on the Commission's part in reopening the debate on foreign policy towards the Mediterranean and taking a fresh look at the Union for the Mediterranean, whilst at the same time ensuring that Europe has a role within it.
The principal purpose is to demonstrate the shared commitment to human rights which we have, but it also constitutes the legal basis for sanctions in the event of grave human rights violations.

As someone just said, it has also been confirmed that small and medium-sized enterprises will be able to participate in the work of the EIT and enjoy its benefits.
Continued efforts are essential for full transposition of the acquis and its effective implementation.
The current economic crisis is not advantageous to minorities, for it poisons conflicts and gives ground to far-right demagoguery.

I have met with the French Minister for Agriculture, Mr Barnier, who is already committed to having a discussion on these sectors at the November meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers.
The main problem is eutrophication, the consequences of which the rapporteur also described well.

As I also suggested in written declaration 0021/2009, which I tabled with colleagues of mine, the EU needs a special financial mechanism to prevent and combat the effects of climate change.
I voted in favour of the report on the EU agricultural product quality policy because to me, it seems extremely relevant in two areas.

- (PL) Madam President, we are witnessing serious events taking place in the field of international politics.
It is clear, and this is my last point, Mr President ...
(DE) Madam President, I have the following request.
My feeling is that workers probably know the 'flexi' part very well, but are less clear on that of security in this new world of work.
We must come forward with a proposal to abolish the unanimity rule in the rescue funds, because it cannot work.
This will give service providers a better opportunity to compare different markets and obtain the overview needed to be able to expand their operations.

The programme's objectives are ambitious, perhaps too ambitious given the available budget of EUR 55 million, but it is nonetheless a good starting point.
Together, we need to ensure that the EU plays a key role in their transition from persecuted opposition to a democratic government.
Many of us cherish the hope that there are some small 'green shoots' in your speech, in the promises that you made to our group, in the speech by Commissioner Andor and in the institutional agreement that we have to submit future European legislation for environmental impact assessment.
Rational mutual dialogue on a constant basis is also the way to deny sustenance to extremists on both sides of the border and thereby nip in the bud or severely restrict potentially dangerous activities they might undertake in the future.
First, taxation is a matter of national sovereignty for each Member State.
Mr President, another thing I do not understand is why a certain fellow Member said that what they want is to take their country - and this is a legitimate view - out of the European Union.
We must, at the same time, not overlook the fact that the lack of progress towards a better way of life is also connected to the traditions of these groups, to which they continue to cling.
The Cotonou Article 96 consultations have to be started first.
We have seen a slight change in this strategy.
It is a real revolution which will bring about huge structural changes to the model of production and consumption and, ultimately, to our very way of life.
For this reason I do not support introducing an interest-rate cap.
European stakeholders must be involved and the functioning of the IFRS should be monitored.
My country is one such example: it was created in 1830 by breaking away from the state created in 1815 by the Congress of Vienna.

Mr President, I thank the Commissioner and the Belgian Presidency for their success in Cancún, because in Cancún, we were able to applaud the Copenhagen trauma away.
Member of the Commission. - I am going to the places close to Athens.
Convention 188 is nothing more than a part of the application of this agenda to the fisheries sector, which was not covered by the standard contract on seafaring work and, as previous speakers said, it is very important that we also have a minimum coverage at global level in this sector too.
We consider the progressive modulation of aid rather an excessive and probably counterproductive measure if the objective is still to safeguard European agricultural production.
How effective is EURES?
(The Member agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8) of the Rules of Procedure)
The sea is currently gaining a new role in the context of the global world, as a geostrategic and geopolitical stage that gives Europe a central role.
I do not think that our expectations should be too low ahead of Cancún.
You will regret it because the people who locked up these innocent citizens will be saying to them, 'You see, we can do what we want: the Western world only wants our markets.'
South Stream is a rival project to Nabucco and does not meet at all the needs to diversify energy supply sources in order to guarantee the EU's energy security.
We need to redouble our efforts and to stand up for the people living in the Romany camps in conditions that are absolutely inhumane and unacceptable; we need to forget the mother whose baby was almost abducted and the family of Mrs Reggiani, raped and killed just under a year ago, sadly a case that has occupied this Parliament.
The reason is very simple: we must use the post-electoral context to point out that the Union's external policy is based on respect for human rights, including minority rights.
Only through a united and coordinated approach will the EU's diplomacy eventually succeed.
I am sure those who are in the visitors' gallery thought that it was quite a simple matter to move pets between Member States, but because we are dealing with issues around animal health - and indeed human health - it is not quite so simple.

Written statements (Rule 142)
In common with the vast majority of my fellow Members, I consider the budget of EUR 60 million appropriated to this initiative to be not nearly sufficient.
I welcome in particular the fact that the European Parliament voted, after an intense debate - and probably to the surprise of many observers - for the establishment of an efficient European telecom regulator, as a facilitator for bringing together the national regulators, and for the dialogue between the national regulators and the Commission.
The abolition of EU visas since 2009 shows Serbia's citizens that the EU has a favourable view of the reforms being undertaken in the country.
It makes our labour markets less competitive and less flexible.
I believe that as an MEP, it is worth mentioning, here and now, that one of the basic conditions for the free movement of people is to have a complete Schengen system operating efficiently and built on mutual trust.
We also have an intense biannual human rights dialogue and then of course sectoral dialogues on different issues, trade obviously being one of particular importance.
With the adoption of this package in a few months' time, the EU will demonstrate that its commitment, as well as its leadership, in the global fight against climate change is as strong as ever.
(Applause)
Over there, several hundreds of thousands of 'eco-vehicles' are already on the road, and the number of filling stations with hydrogen pumps is steadily increasing.
I believe that we want the citizens of Europe to remain healthy for as long as possible and to have the best possible access to high quality medical care at the lowest possible cost.
This is particularly true of the Union for the Mediterranean where it is evident that we need more elaborate instruments in order to develop some kind of effective policy on the part of the European Union.
Only one in four businesses trade across borders and those who trade limit their operations to only a few Member States.
They do not instil public confidence.
First of all, fluctuations in the euro exchange rate have very little impact on tourism flows within the European Union.
The interim agreements are only transitory in nature, as they will be replaced by full regional EPAs.
The Commission appreciates that the European Parliament has opted for a procedure which allows for a vote - to take place tomorrow, already - on the reports for these four countries, without amendments to the Commission's proposals.
I would therefore like to encourage the ACP countries to ratify the revised Cotonou Agreement as soon as possible.
However, its role should not be restricted to just this region.
Mr President, Commissioner, the EGTC cannot solve every problem, of course, and I realise - as we have heard - that a lot of Member States have yet to start using it.
Last autumn, the World Wide Fund for Nature published a report revealing that, if we continue to use the Earth's resources as we are doing right now, by the mid 2030s we will need two planets.
We do think it right for the Member States to have three years to adapt their national legislation.
We won considerable support in committee for my amendment that contained the word 'may', but now you have informed us, Commissioner, that you would reject that in any case, so it seems we have been wasting our time.
The discussion at the informal meeting of Heads of State or Government in October sought to strengthen the external dimension of the Lisbon Strategy and confirmed that the Renewed Lisbon Strategy is still the right framework to meet the principal challenges that confront us, in particular the challenge of globalisation.
Secondly, we know that at least 75% of the money spent by the EU is devoted to completely useless and harmful causes.
We will, therefore, think about all of that.
Therefore, I believe the most important question now is: how and what could we further build on the achievements of the Swedish Presidency?
People need access to jobs and education, effective public services and more.
So I am not going to respond again to all these questions that have been put because, honestly, I think I already answered them in my first speech.
I would like to stress that the Commission's new revised proposal for this directive may genuinely help to achieve greater harmonisation, improve international protection standards and enhance the quality and efficiency of asylum procedures.
I have been through many crises, but nothing like this.
The inclusion of safety and territorial cohesion as priority objectives will doubtless improve the design of future transport policy and will contribute to making its practical application fit with the public's expectations, needs and possibilities.
I believe therefore that the Union should prepare its own standpoint on this subject.
For many years the European Commission has had plans to close this loophole in company law.
The three-year reform of the Financial Regulation will enable us to establish the legal basis for this simplification, but I do not think that tinkering with the tolerable risk of error is the right way to go.
Here you are calling for Eurobonds, but in Germany you have declared Eurobonds to be a kind of blasphemy.
In fact, there are not that many tariffs any more between the US and the EU.
Increased interinstitutional coherence and cooperation would give the EU's human rights policy more credibility on the international stage.
We hear that a revision of the first railway package is indeed on the way.
Also, from a health perspective, this scheme would protect people from potentially carcinogenic, mutagenic, reprotoxic or biocumulative products which can sometimes be traced in textiles.
Let them set the day.
They never require imprisonment.
I think it is a very important issue.
A much better option to prevent accidents through tiredness would be more effective monitoring of the driving times and rest periods in force rather than artificially restricting the working times of the self-employed.
This does not seem like the right solution to me.
The reality of price management is complex: scarce raw materials, higher production costs, high fuel prices, dependency on harvests, exports and the world market - a dense network of causes that have to be disentangled by means of targeted measures.
At the same time, it is absolutely astonishing that we have been entirely incapable of reorganising our own activities in order to meet the new requirements.
There is also the challenge of legislating better.
It was with this in mind that we successfully managed on both sides to come to some agreement on the issue of labelling hazardous substances, so that the report was in line with REACH but also helps those who work with products which, in the past, have led to chronic conditions and death - conditions such as asbestos-related mesotheliomia and, to an extent, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease caused by working conditions and by inhaling dust.
Indeed this is only way for peace to be achieved in that region.
These trade measures are not 'stand-alone', and come on top of the significant humanitarian and development assistance - amounting to EUR 480 million - that the EU has granted to Pakistan.
on behalf of the EFD Group. - (NL) Mr President, the many, sometimes incredible, irregularities in the local and regional elections in Ukraine on 31 October must be a red flag for the European Union.
That is the de-coupling system.
That means equilibrium and the supply of oil, and, in addition, the fact that money has been made out of the arms trade.
I hope that Europe can afford to do that and that it does actually invest in children and young people and in the European schools.
The idea itself can only be welcomed, especially if we consider how costly and cumbersome the current procedure is, having to apply for a separate patent in each Member State.
We may welcome this or we may regret it.
However, I was rushed from the office when I heard comments made about standards, and I think paragraph 10 is particularly important in this resolution and should be read and perhaps added to.
The PPE members of my Group hope that the European Council will ask the Member States that have not yet done so to continue with their ratification procedures as is only fit and proper.
I am heartened that the EU is extending its sanctions.
It is difficult to judge who is right and we will not know the truth until the end of 2009.
This makes sense if the relevant data really do not impose any additional burden, in other words, if the Member States are indeed in a position to collate these data using already existing data sources.
Of course, much remains to be done, in terms both of economic and institutional reforms, and the steps taken should be consolidated.
in writing. - (FR) I welcome the agreement reached on this Regulation at first reading.
Many of my fishermen are doing mixed fishing, and for them, discards are more than a waste and a contradiction: they are an abomination.
That also means deliverable atomic bombs, considering developing missile capacity and the launching of Iran's first satellite.
Moreover, co-movements in spreads in other countries are also evidence of clear risks of spillovers to other Member States.
The euro's success therefore means success in the process of building an entity designed to promote European values at international level and confirm the European Union as the main player in business and financial relations within the global economy.
As regards the Parliament, this document, for which I voted, includes the needs arising from Croatia's accession in 2013, the increase in the number of MEPs by 18 and the need for extra staff following the Treaty of Lisbon's entry into force.
That is something that we lack.

We are also dealing with a global leadership crisis.
The fact is that rich countries, for example Norway and Switzerland, simply do not want to join the EU.
We fully endorse the statements and positions taken so far by the Presidency, Council and Commission, but we are also asking the Council to ensure that EU Member States and their ambassadors in Tehran are fully complying with EU guidelines on human rights defenders and on the prevention of torture.

(BG) Mr President, I will agree, to a certain extent, with what Commissioner Füle said, namely, that we can actually see tangible progress in Macedonia's development as it advances towards the European Union.
Secondly, we must create an agency for innovation and accelerate the funding of research and development in order to advance very quickly and close the technological gap between clean vehicles and safe vehicles.
The two things are not mutually exclusive, but complementary: positive contacts with China, but clear defence of religious freedom and human rights.
We want to know, now, what obligations the European Commission's negotiators are accepting on behalf of 500 million European Union citizens.
This new concept is, I believe, relevant to consideration of the outermost regions in order to guarantee them sustainable and balanced growth.

in writing. - (FR) I voted for the Chatzimarkakis report, which seeks to improve the CAP's budgetary execution and transparency, in other words to identify the beneficiaries of aid for agriculture.
I believe that, as well as the Commission, Parliament played an important part in this improvement, in particular, the Committee on Budgetary Control, which sets great store by the subject of transparency and the effective and efficient use of public funds.
All of these are huge tasks for the diplomatic service and ones for which the High Representative needs our full support.
The EU can be influential in contributing to the start of an unprejudiced and constructive dialogue that would respect both sides.
We could start with administrative expenditure, for example, and in this respect we are still a long way from meeting the Commissioner's request to keep the increase below 1%.
We must think about the transparency of risks, the supervisory powers of regulators and the salaries at this type of institution.
In its 'Pierre de Coubertin' action plan, the White Paper therefore seeks to promote volunteering in sport and non-profit sport organisations through specific actions, including a study on volunteering and exchange of good practices within the informal EU 'non-profit sport organisation' working group.

The next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
Recently, President Lukashenko visited Moscow and signed very important agreements with President Medvedev.
I agree with Mr Saryusz-Wolski on this point: we have indeed called for this together, and received far too little support from the Council - or rather the Member States.
Nowadays confidence is the keyword, one that is reflected in the documents of the European Union as well.
(Applause)
As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I sought to uphold this idea by drawing attention to some of the main challenges we are facing in the following areas, to cite but a few examples: the scarcity and efficient use of resources, waste recovery and treatment, food quality and security, demographic change, new epidemics, and conservation of nature and biodiversity.
According to a survey published by the Region of Sicily at the end of 2009, 75% of citizens believe that European funds have no positive impact whatsoever, or very little.

Agenda: see Minutes
In spite of the fact that gender equality is a fundamental right, gender inequality on the labour market, in terms of salaries, employment rates and quality of employment, remains a serious structural problem.
Your report, of course, also expresses some concerns on the abandoning of the constitutional approach and on the extension of opt-in arrangements for particular Member States.
In view of this, EU officials and temporary agents from the diplomatic services of the Member States should have the same rights and obligations and be treated equally, particularly as regards the eligibility to assume all positions under equivalent conditions.
Under the pretext of facilitating business opportunities within international air transport, this promotes the interests of multinationals within the sector at the expense of national companies and their respective strategic interests, including those that, as is the case in Portugal with TAP, are publicly owned.

The Commission's approach to the question of the Polish shipyards, however, runs counter to these declarations.
The reforms undertaken by Serbia will enable the country to make significant progress along the path to future EU membership.
We cannot suddenly make up new competences or enter into areas where we know that it is actually sometimes the Member States that have the competences, or we are at least limited in what we can propose, or we have to work together with the other institutions.
Rather, I believe that this situation is entirely to be expected, given the number of states which make up the Union and their particular histories and interests.
38 000 performers asked for our support to redress this discrimination.
We have to stop thinking of Frontex as a temporary or isolated measure.
It may not be the job of this regulation, but it is the job of us Members to remind the Council of this and exert pressure to ensure that the text on origin marking that has been on the table since 2005 is at last put to good use.
It currently does this for employed drivers, so clearly it can also do so for self-employed drivers.

We must not confuse bureaucracy with transparency, because not every entry registered on a piece of paper or every approval recorded in a file contributes to making cohesion projects transparent.
Such is the case with our former fellow Member, Mr de Gucht. Such is the case with the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Mr Juncker.
Then we would have a deletion, but it would continue as follows: 'calls in particular on the Russian authorities to adopt preventive protective measures as regards human rights defenders, such as starting an investigation as soon as threats faced by them are known by the prosecutor and the judicial system;'.
The Consumer Rights Directive will enable full harmonisation of the rights of European consumers.
Consequently, I would like to ask the Commission whether it would not be a good idea nonetheless to implement veterinary border controls at which the owner of a pet animal must demonstrate that the animal travelling with him or her is free of dangerous diseases, has been vaccinated and has its papers in order in respect of the destination country.
On the other hand, I think it is also very important that we managed to keep the food security item on the political agenda and the result of the several summits we have been witnessing in 2009 has certainly been that it is now high on the international agenda and that, whenever world leaders meet, for example, latterly in Pittsburgh for the G20, there is talk of development cooperation and development policy.
Unfortunately, no mention is made of these in the report, just as no mention is made of the unacceptable conditions under which thousands of people travelling with no travel papers are held on islands and in towns of the Mediterranean, affecting the human dignity of us all.

We have seen some examples of that.
It is no coincidence that Moldova is the poor relation in the European family.
(DE) Madam President, I would not have asked for the floor again had not the Commissioner tried to play the victim in his closing remarks. Commissioner, you must come to terms with the fact that you are in a European forum in which you have a specific obligation to be very careful about what you say, and what you said in the Il Messaggero interview was factually incorrect.
The fact that consular staff are not aware of the visa categories 'D' and 'C' seems rather strange.
(ES) Municipal elections were held in Nicaragua on 9 November this year.
It is important to distinguish between a real crisis and a business matter in relation to gas and at what point senior political figures should enter the negotiations and what the market should control.

In assessing them, we are interested in consideration being given to the specific nature of the nuclear technology used in Romania, compared with the nuclear technologies used in the EU.
Baroness Ashton, instead of just a few leaders acting together or in isolation - in Portuguese we say 'it is hard to be the priest in one's own parish' - what is needed is for Europe as a whole to take a leading role in aiding these reforms and to find a new paradigm for the Middle East that avoids radicalism and respects human rights, and women's rights in particular.
We must certainly take into account the competences of Member States in that regard.
Because - in the words of Oxfam - 'The European Parliament is today setting a world standard by pressing for a European Robin Hood tax'.
Mr Virrankoski, with regard to the preliminary draft budget, you say that it is already extremely tight and that what we are actually doing is tightening it even more.

This is the policy we have to push forward.
The Treaty of Lisbon lays the foundations for creating the European Research Area, strengthening European action in an area that is vital for economic growth and employment.
(NL) Madam President, Parliament's draft budget for 2011 is EUR 1.7 billion.
The global financial crisis has had a significant impact on both revenues and expenditure in all our countries, even if the extent and nature of that impact is not the same in all cases and the capacity of individual Member States to handle the consequences is also very different.
This TV station broadcasts 24/7 in Chinese and English via satellites over Asia, Europe, Australia and North America.
(SV) Madam President, wishful thinking is not enough to bring about a changeover to sustainable, renewable energy sources and to a climate-friendly society.
However, I firmly believe that, with regard to certain issues, it may be taking things a step too far.
Microcredits are unquestionably a major aid in combating poverty and an instrument for achieving the millennium goals.
Copenhagen stood for much more than a climate summit.
It is therefore good that we are talking about it as the reason for that - namely increasing demand - will not be going away and so prices will also continue to rise.
Your announcement today that you plan to introduce EU requirements for mandatory women quotas in corporate boardrooms is already quite promising.

In fact, we should adopt measures which will ensure that any accused person can enjoy sound procedural guarantees, anywhere in Europe.
The European Parliament has been saying since March that this will be our list of priorities for 2011 and that we would like those budget lines which favour youth, education and mobility to be appropriately funded, so that resources will also be found for innovative undertakings in the field of mobility, youth and education.
More specifically, bearing in mind the limited resources and means available to us, as well as the very short time period that remains, we must ensure that all these international forums and action plans are used strategically in order to support and complement the UN plan of action without undermining it in any way whatsoever.
Whilst I share your aims and always want to do things as quickly as we can - and Mr Kirkhope's aims of price transparency and consumer protection - I think that, in our speed to get this through, we have drifted away, certainly from the position that the Committee on Transport adopted at the end of May, and that the position that Council has come up with, the so-called compromise position, is different from the position that we went for in the Committee on Transport.
This problem is also dealt with in the Regulation establishing the general provisions for the structural funds and the cohesion fund and in the guidelines for regional support in the 2007-2013 period aimed at ensuring that these investments make a real and sustainable contribution to regional development.

Both EUROPOL and the European Union will lack democratic legitimacy until you put the Lisbon Treaty to a referendum.
I listened in detail to your speech, took notes and will read it again.
My fellow rapporteurs, Mrs del Castillo Vera and Mr Harbour, and I have worked together closely to achieve a coherent and efficient proposal for the end-users of these directives, namely the Commission and regulators, but one that is also positive and valuable to those looking for legal certainty, encouragement for investment, and a dynamic and balanced market, that is, operators and their employees, as well as for the primary beneficiaries of the numerous services and quality at a fair and accessible price: the consumers.
The general condemnation of Parliament regarding the suppression of information by the Commission relating to the ongoing negotiations on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) and the limitations which, by proceeding in this manner, the Commission has attempted to impose on scrutiny and democratic control, have been quite clear.

I should like all the same to emphasise that we have had a solid legislative base since 1975 and especially since 2006, and that the latter enabled me, in the years 1975 to 1980, to encourage women in my country who were being discriminated against to start legal proceedings against their employers, in particular from the public sector.
Essentially, these are the reasons why two Member States opted for protocols protecting against the unexpected consequences of the effects of the Charter.

The non-participation of the aviation sector in this system could cause important compensatory costs on long-term.
This begins during the school years, during PE classes, and extends right through to high-performance training in top-class sport, for here far too little consideration is given to female traits and female biological requirements. More attention needs to be directed to this.

As a result of Copenhagen, we can come to the following four conclusions.

the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) should support the reintegration of individual redundant workers into employment, and I would reiterate that assistance from the EGF is not a substitute for measures that are the responsibility of companies by virtue of national law or collective agreements, nor is it intended to finance the restructuring of companies or sectors;
Patients must be absolutely certain that the medicines they are taking are actually the medicines they expect to take.

What Mr Verhofstadt cannot deny, however, is that recent years have seen a decline in the car industry in Europe and also in Flanders, and Mr Noels, the economist to whom I referred, has said that high labour costs were one of the reasons for the Americans closing Opel Antwerp instead of one of the others.

I would also have preferred to see stronger sales promotion measures instead of a greater amount of intervention, such as butter fat being used once again in the ice cream industry.

The repressive mechanisms of the bourgeoisie have a rich history of criminal activity against communists and social fighters for whom this classification was used in order to label them as being dangerous to 'public order and security'.
Frontex, for example, should send back ships carrying bogus refugees to their countries of origin instead of playing the role of a sort of benevolent welcome committee.
This proposal must therefore be rejected.
Further to the request of this House, in February we provided the negotiating directives for the EU-GCC FTA, including all its updates according to the agreed procedures and in respect of the confidentiality rules.
Openness, the right of access to information, and the right to good governance are all crucial if the public are to have confidence in the ability of the EU institutions to monitor their rights.

I would like to finish by saying that violence against women is a problem of abuse, it is a problem of cowardice, it is a problem of intolerance and, above all, Madam President, it is a problem of fear and powerlessness, of fear of accepting the will of others and, above all, fear of peacefully imposing will and reason based on argument, peacefully and not through violence.

As usual, our discussions amount to nothing, and then we hear Commissioner Michel almost eulogising Mr Nkunda.

The adoption of the budget each year is one of the most important duties we MEPs have.

Domestic violence and forced marriages continue to be common.
in writing. - (FR) I voted against Mrs Vălean's report because it calls for liberalisation of the energy sector and a liberal European energy policy, and we all know what tragic consequences that would have for workers in the sector and for more and more of our citizens, who might even experience regular power cuts.
We must therefore emphasise that the improvements to the system will, apart from anything else, be beneficial for patients in the long term, since better use will be made of drugs and better use will also be made of the resources employed by the relevant authorities for protecting public health.

(NL) Mr President, I had the honour of drawing up an opinion on Frontex on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, but that opinion was rejected by a narrow majority because the Left refused to accept that the problems involving Libya and Turkey were explicitly mentioned in the text.
I commend this report.
If common sense prevails, this Parliament will vote for a reduction of the EU budget for 2012.

Some of them have not even been charged and duly tried.

This Presidency, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is a Presidency of a pro-European country, a country that clearly understands that it is defending its own interests through the European project, in a country committed to European ideals, in a country led by European politicians who clearly understand that what Europe needs is to develop the European project and that this European project is probably the most generous, most critical and most important project of modern times, that this European project is important for Europeans, for the European economy, and also important for the world.

The effects of a nuclear disaster often cross national boundaries.

In addition, in order to combat unemployment among low-skilled people, as well as to promote the employment of senior citizens, it is imperative to encourage the recognition of national qualifications between the Member States, and to encourage certification by validating skills acquired through informal apprenticeship.
What this really means is that more of the decisions on the shape, content and future of Europe should be taken by citizens, and not just by representatives of the government that happens to be in power.
Predictions suggest that there will be a shortage of workers.
Even in a period of low inflation, resulting from the crisis and the trend in raw material prices, there are still microeconomic problems with price formation.

This is serious.
How would this mindset be defined?

I am referring in this case to the public key infrastructure.

Solidarity is one of the European Union's fundamental values, and an economic recession is a good time to show it.

We need to do things better.
This is totally natural.
What an outrageous and baseless comparison!
I am grateful to you, Mr President-in-Office, for having already set the ball in motion.
We did not join the euro, thank God.
A similar process is now at work with Europol, which has gradually extended its remit to cover a whole series of crimes that are national in nature - but with the rather fascinating oversight that its personnel still have diplomatic immunity; in other words, they cannot be held to account for abuse of police powers.
Those are extremely appealing prospects, particularly in economically strained times.

This resolution has the support of all the political groups and it is important because, quite simply, it highlights the challenges of an ageing population - these challenges that mean that, today, in Europe, we have more than seven million people suffering from Alzheimer's disease, a figure that it is estimated will double over the next 20 years.
So let us try to act collectively.
That is something positive, and the discussion in depth is there and should continue.
Germany is currently investigating shortening the operational time spans of its power stations.
Firstly, the main problem of hydrogen powered vehicles lies not in the vehicle manufacturing process itself, but in refuelling.

We, the nations of Europe, simply cannot condone this enormous injustice by failing to act.
As you know, I hope the governments will very soon agree on that and so I hope that there will be a political decision in the European Council confirming the decisions regarding the European Stability Mechanism and, of course, you know what our position is.
This phenomenon is reflected not only in violence in the family against women and girls, but also through exploitation, acts of sexual violence, human trafficking, honour crimes, dangerous traditional practices, such as the burning of brides or early marriages, and other forms of violence against women's bodies, minds and dignity.

I agree with the introduction of a tax on financial transactions which could help to tackle the highly damaging trading patterns in financial markets, improve the efficiency of the market itself, reduce price volatility and create incentives for the financial sector to make long-term investments with added value for the real economy.

It is also important, and in this respect I fully support the rapporteur, to examine and establish the limits of consent requested of users, whether by governments or private companies, in terms of giving up part of their privacy in return for certain Internet services or privileges.

- (NL) Mr President, I did not indeed approve the Gruber report on the policy plan for legal migration for two main reasons.
This would be the right forum to tackle major developments in a constructive manner, in good time and on the basis of mutual trust.
The EU needs its own resources in the context of future diminishing budgets in the EU Member States.

In the words of Paul Morand, a French diplomat and writer, the Mediterranean is, above all, the anti-desert civilisation.
Is it not the problem now that biofuels have a bad name not because of what Europe has done but because of what the US is doing in feeding large quantities of corn to cars instead of to cows?
I would just like to pick up three points very briefly from the excellent contribution from my colleague, Joseph Daul.
Parliament has the power to deliver for citizens and the Internal Market Committee was determined to go for a strong ban whilst securing exemption for traditional Inuit hunting.
However, before we begin to act upon these priorities, we must draw some lessons from the economic collapse, which has spread permanently across the world.
For their part, all the governments of Europe, including the Swiss, must agree to cooperate with a view to returning the money and property acquired by President Ben Ali's family.
So I say to the Commission that small businesses are going to be the engines of job re-creation.
Nevertheless, we regret that what has been proposed by the Commission and endorsed by the Parliament is not a solution merely for the eurozone, but one that includes those whose currency is not the euro.
(DE) Mrs Malmström, thank you for your excellent reply.
The European Parliament and the Council legislate on equal terms.
We in the EPP-ED Group do not advocate binding targets; we believe compulsion, as well as the setting of sectoral targets for renewable energy resources, should be subject to subsidiarity.
There has been a delay in reforming the shipbuilding industry.
As an example we might mention here the comprehensive EPA intended for the West African economies.
Therefore, in short, we are asking the Commission to be swift and dynamic in legally transposing them.
It is supposed to be the guardian of European law, including the legislation that we have adopted, but when it comes to the trade agreement with Canada, it says that it is important that some people make a lot of money, but it is not important for European law to remain law.
Now, I am talking about unjustified advantages within agricultural policy as well as the fact that our anti-corruption policy is, to a large degree, not as successful as we always claim it is, and the fact that, to a certain extent, the EU's administration is rather unwieldy - the very fact that we are here in Strasbourg is an example of this.
The Commission is pleased that this debate is being held on the implementation and evaluation of this important instrument for the common foreign and security policy.
There is also a second aspect on which I have placed particular stress, and that is to try to identify specific priorities, or, in other words, to produce a summary of what the basic guiding elements of action by the European Union with regard to human rights throughout the world might be.
Firstly, we oppose the situation whereby the MEPs' voluntary pension fund is being funded by taxpayers' money.
The key aim of this measure is to revitalise the Western Balkan economies through privileged access to the EU market.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(RO) Given that an ever-increasing number of families in Europe, especially in the context of the economic crisis and rising unemployment rate, are spending in excess of 10% of their monthly income on energy bill payments, I would like to ask you what specific measures the European Commission is intending to take to reduce energy poverty.
Effective enforcement of the provisions contained in the regulation is also important, so that they will not be merely hollow declarations.
I shudder to think what is going to happen to ordinary producers of very modest proportions when they, too, are subjected to this huge and totally unnecessary burden of regulation.
Written statements (Rule 149)
This has never happened in history.
It is, of course, very important to show compassion to the country's inhabitants going through this difficult ordeal, which includes finding specific solutions to facilitate the procedures for adopting children who have been left orphaned after this disaster and offering concrete assistance to the population which has been so sorely tried.
Action to tackle cardiovascular disease (vote)
There has been conflict between ourselves in Parliament and the Commission.
Secondly, the structural dependency of the euro area on finite resources must be brought to an end.
7.

Similarly, the future of the European Union lies in its continued enlargement and in creating and building on new possibilities and better opportunities.
To help Ukraine's new government or to interfere in the internal affairs of that country in advance of the local elections and prevent them from improving the situation in the country by themselves?
I also use this argument in reply to healthcare authorities in the Member States who are not enthusiastic about the prospect of well-informed patients because they believe that well-informed patients are demanding and will ask for more expensive drugs.
I believe that this is the right way to go.
It should be noted that, due to the common visa policy and the exclusive competence of the European Union in this area, only the Union can negotiate and conclude a visa waiver agreement, and not the individual Member States.
When it comes to expert groups, they should be seen for what they are: another playing field in which participants can put their interests forward.

All these problems can apparently be avoided through use of a new inactivated vaccine, which, in addition to preventing potential disturbances in the internal livestock market, will also enable the development of new, further-reaching - which is what really matters - prevention strategies for combating this disease.
For example, in paragraph 20 unreasonable demands are made of a democratic party.
However, we do not want Albania to be isolated.
More seriously, the meeting was held inside the European Parliament, behind closed doors, and not even Parliament's own staff were allowed in.
The example of the Great Barrier Reef demonstrates that marine ecosystems can regenerate if the necessary environmental protection measures are put in place.
Therefore, Commissioner, my question to you is: what is the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) doing in this regard?
Cathy Ashton was the leader in the Upper House in the UK when the Lisbon Treaty was steered through - no mean feat.
On the one hand it is the responsibility of producers to ensure that their products conform to the valid European laws, and on the other hand it is the responsibility of the Member States to ensure proper supervision of the EU market.
Poverty amongst women is a really serious problem that the EU needs to solve.
This requirement has been highlighted even further by taking into account the various ways in which PNR data can be used.
Mr President, I have listened with great interest to the speeches given by Mr Nicholson, Mrs in 't Veld, Mr Albrecht and Mrs Alfano.
That has to change.
The initial steps were taken in November 2000 when the Council, in accordance with the Tampere Conclusions, adopted a programme of measures to implement the principle of mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters.
I agree that the initial funding and its governing structure should come from the Community budget, and that both the public contributions from Member States and the private contributions should be used to develop innovation and knowledge communities that are in line with the Institute's priorities.
In Germany, this affects the milk fund.
(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Berlato's report deals with a combination of health and agricultural issues.
In addition, with regard to including the 'territorial' concept, we must be aware of the need to take account of the specific features of certain regions, such as their geographical disadvantages, their outermost position or the depopulation processes in certain regions.
Europe will no longer be Europe, and no citizen will recognise himself as European if we forget these basics.
I voted in favour of the present report and I consider it to be of great importance during a period of economic and financial crisis, since it is necessary to ensure that all European Union regions develop harmoniously.
in writing. - (BG) Mr. Chairman, Dear colleagues, Mr. Cappato,
This inquiry was carried out for the French authorities by the Inspectorate for active forces and national defence.
The European budget should be the answer right now as we need growth and jobs right now.
We voted on the resolution on media law in Hungary in view of this, taking its positive and negative aspects into account.
However, all the Member States must understand in this respect that Frontex now needs to be upgraded in terms of funding and staffing so that it can actually perform its task really effectively.
However, this does not mean that the existing system is ideal.
At European level voluntary activity is a practical expression of such European values as solidarity, cohesion and social integration.
Mr President, one minute it shall be.
(Applause)
The urgency is to radically change banking system rules, not to take half measures to preserve them.
The number of people having to endure extreme poverty has fallen from 1.8 billion to 1.4 billion.
As regards Portugal, I regret that the measures that have been implemented have not been framed within a coherent and comprehensive action plan submitted to the Commission within the statutory period.
Will you make provision for the suspect or defendant to be heard, so that the judge can decide whether or not he should be sent back to the country in which he is wanted, in order to prevent abuse, such as extradition for political opinions?
Thank you for inviting me.
The scientific community is urgently calling for harmonisation of the rules and procedures and for a general simplification of the financial accountability requirements.
I would like to highlight in the report the need for the ILO's fundamental rules to be complied with, especially with regard to child and forced labour, because there should be openness with asymmetry, yes, but while respecting the rules of fair competition and fair play; never forgetting the interests of our businesses.
We were told that the reason we could not have the measures was because there was no scientific study to back up the Commission proposal.
Amongst other atrocities, rape has been used for many years as a weapon of war and tens of thousands of women and girls are suffering.
This is not only due to the fact that we are experiencing an economic crisis, Commissioner, but also to the fact that the orientation of our agricultural policy has been wrong in recent years.
We focused on adapting and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for limiting the document to cover only issues relating to adapting and reducing the effects of climate change.
We are indebted to the women of our villages, who have contributed incalculably and almost invisibly to the development of the countryside.
The concern that there has been must therefore be transformed into even greater commitment to making the agreement a reality.
I would commend Croatia for the substantial progress achieved in attaining the benchmarks needed to conclude the accession negotiations.
This foresees support for developing countries to implement the national measures for the alleviation of, and adaptation to, climate change.
In spite of the technical nature of these texts, their goal remains the same: to ensure the transparency of mechanisms and procedures applied to persons moving within the European Union.
We cannot have children, hold onto a job outside the home, mind elderly parents and participate in wider society.
Our intention, I repeat, is not to limit the rights of Member States but merely to try to achieve harmonisation that can serve only to provide EU citizens with faster and more robust responses.
(CS) Mr President, I commend the work of the rapporteur, Mr Peter Liese, who, when dealing with the Council, managed to push through most of what Parliament had already proposed at first reading in November of last year.
(The sitting was closed at 9.45 p.m.)
This is an important question I am putting to you and I would really like an answer.
Information and education campaigns for young people are also required.
(Applause)
And we have highlighted the role that local authorities have to play within this - and indeed the need for more of a framework around services of general interest - so that we can ensure that people are getting the services that they need.
By means of the ever more widely accessible new technologies and computer skills, our children are increasingly exposed to the dangers of harassment, child pornography, bullying and incitement to racism.
Unable to control what is going on, we then look to the heavens and try the old mumbo-jumbo.
I wish to thank her, at this juncture, for the commitment shown over the course of these six months.
Draft amending budget No 6/2010: Section II - European Council and Council; Section III - Commission; Section X - European External Action Service (
If we want to achieve complete equality between men and women on the labour market, women need to be fully compensated during maternity leave, and men need to be involved in looking after the children and thus granted paternity leave.
I would therefore like to express support for the Commission, which has roundly condemned the use of force against innocent civilians, who have been, and still are, the victims of intervention by the Sudanese army occupying this region.
Following more than three years' work on the Community Code on Visas and complicated negotiations with the Council, it has finally proved possible to reach a compromise.

In the Åland Islands of Finland and in South Tyrol in Italy, regional autonomy has really stabilised the country.
We were expecting a few hundred and we received 44 000 claims.
Advance notification of outpatient treatment is not mandatory.
Targeted and temporary support measures for European producers could prove useful, in particular, to improve the technological and ecological performance of the European car population, where the regulatory environment, as we know, is the most demanding in the world in terms of environmental legislation.
I intend to make this a regular feature of the European Council meetings.
It is good that Parliament not only welcomes the announcement of a partnership, but also really does monitor the tangible results.
The next item is voting time.
It is in this sense, Mr. Chairman, that the recognition of the precise meaning of the CE marking is of special importance to all of us.
Firstly it needs to be stated very clearly that here today we are talking about a return directive, we are talking about illegal migration, we are not talking about asylum, or talking about asylum procedures.
I am pleased that the financial impact of irregularities, as far as they have been identified, fell from EUR 1 024 million in 2007 to EUR 783.2 million in 2008 (the fall affected all spending areas, except direct expenditure and pre-accession funds).
I don't know whether or not he's planning to call it Stubb/SMEs.com, but I wish him every success with it and I must say that I share my colleagues' caution, as expressed in the oral question, on the subject of additional marking and its compatibility with the existing system.
I would like to inform you about worrying statistics recorded this year in the Romanian schools: one pupil out of four suffers from chronic diseases.
We cannot compromise on 2° C. This means that all the developed countries of the world must make reductions of between 25% and 40%.
The money can be used to pay for help in finding new jobs, tailor-made training, assistance in becoming self-employed or starting up a company, mobility and support for disadvantaged or older workers.
2. (
I do not believe that any religion which aims to do good could require something like this from its followers.
The same is true of the fight against corruption and organised crime, as outlined in your report.
3.
We have had long discussions on this topic, but a majority was against it.
This is why we must harmonise our approaches in the area of economic policy more closely than in the past and, in light of this, trusting that there is agreement among the political groups, I ask that we support the Andersson report and vote to adopt it.
We will therefore have to take tougher measures for western Baltic cod, but can maybe take somewhat less tough measures for eastern cod.
Mr President, honourable Members, first of all may I apologise on behalf of my colleagues, Vice-President Verheugen and Mr Dimas, who unfortunately cannot be here this morning to take part in this debate.
As you know, I even made public a letter in which I called on the Member States to help me in regard to this issue of gender balance.
Yet the Commission should also take careful note that every chronic disorder related to the immune system dysfunction is on the increase, for example, asthma, allergy, multiple sclerosis, autism, diabetes, epilepsy, fibromyalgia and many more.
Their amendment concerns declaring 2010 a year devoted to the memory of Frederic Chopin.
I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution by Mrs Kolarska-Bobińska, because I generally share her views on how the future energy strategy of the European Union should be oriented: towards greater autonomy in relation to third countries providing fossil fuels, towards an opening up of the Member States which are still 'isolated' in terms of energy and which are not yet properly linked up to the European energy system, towards encouraging the development of renewable energies, and towards an external energy provision within the framework of the new European External Action Service.
In connection with the employment summit, the Commission adopted on 3 June a communication entitled 'A Shared Commitment for Employment' which set out three key priorities for action: maintaining employment, creating jobs and supporting mobility, improving qualifications and improving the link between the skills offered and the needs of the labour market and improving access to the labour market.
So, the tax will be directed at customers.
in writing. - (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats have chosen to vote in favour of the report on the active inclusion of people excluded from the labour market.
Innovation in micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises requires support for public research and its results must be made available in a simple way, without bureaucracy, whether it be in terms of energy efficiency, using new sources of energy and new production processes, recycling and making better use of resources, or creating jobs with rights, or whether it be in human and social terms, with a view to social progress.
The programme promotes mobility both inside and beyond the EU's borders and encourages the inclusion of all young people, irrespective of their educational, social and cultural background.
Of course they will be absolutely key to any success in dealing with the financial crisis, so we will deliver, we have already produced a SME business act and of course there is a follow-up, an implementation of the business act.
The final document intends to grant autonomous trade preferences to the country in relation to 75 product lines of interest (mainly textiles and clothing) in the form of exemption from customs duties, with the exception of one product (ethanol) for which a tariff rate quota applies.
It is absolutely right to say that differentiation is also key here, because the various countries are very different: Ukraine is in the forefront, in principle, then there are Moldova and Georgia, and then there is a country like Belarus, in which the situation is very delicate.
Yes, we need to balance our budgets.
It should read: 'Calls on Serbia to enter into dialogue with Kosovo without any longer referring to new negotiations on its status'.
Without it the implementation of our goals and interests in Central Asia would be very difficult.
There is a significant nuclear risk to Ireland because of the nuclear plants on the west coast of Britain; Sellafield is the most famous.
It is common for help to be refused to mothers and father travelling alone with small children as a result of this lack of knowledge among carriers and airports.
It is therefore absolutely necessary to revamp Europe's universities so that they can play a decisive role in society and in an economy based on knowledge and innovation.
The experience gained indicates that the challenges should be tackled with a degree of caution, however.
I refer here above all to our closest neighbours Ukraine and Moldova.
Secondly, we are also supporting cash-for-work programmes so, again, we can build a transition from relief to recovery.
A European exchange would transform the current 'non-market' of paper barrels into an efficient, regulated and monitored real market based on real barrels of oil.
In this connection, we would refer to the British example of the BBC, where alliances have been proposed between different partners in terms of development, production and distribution.
In May 2009, the World Health Organisation (WHO) attributed moderate severity to influenza A (H1N1), and in June of the same year, the WHO declared a level 6 alert, corresponding to a pandemic phase.
The proposal includes a number of measures relating to access to repair information for new cars, so as to ensure effective competition in the repair market, so that small businesses will not suffer as a result of the report.
It is also necessary to produce educational tools designed to inform Internet users (e.g. technologies for managing 'traces' left on the web and resources for protecting privacy).
This is apparent in the context of the media law.
Naturally, we are hoping for the support of the European Parliament in this matter.
But, of course, we have heard from many colleagues today that there is considerable disappointment in this Parliament.
I believe that the Charter on the Rights of Energy Consumers will, slowly but surely, help to change the energy market, which is something that we have been looking forward to for a long time.
(CS) I am delighted that, despite the spectre of politics, agreement has been reached on the harmonisation of legislation protecting all Europeans who are planning a holiday abroad and who wish to rent accommodation abroad without risk.
Debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law
Real North-South solidarity is required.
However, the sovereignty of the Member States must be retained.
Moreover - I cannot see the President of the European Commission here; I should like to express my perplexity as to why explanations were only requested from the Greek authorities and from Greece about a practice which was applied to saturation point by numerous Member States in the euro area over the ten years from 1998 to 2008, as reported in numerous articles in the foreign press recently.
(The oral amendment was adopted)
The budget underlying this report - which is made explicit in the first item of the compromise proposal's preamble, accepting an end to dairy quotas - is unacceptable to us, which is why we voted against.
The capacities of the Haitian Government are not functioning.
An insidious veil is clouding our vision, and we cannot even see it.

Integrity of cemeteries is not a case to accept.
For most of this decade the European Union has been engaged in internal institutional debates.
Creating the Electronic System of Travel Authorisation is not justified financially. This is why I have suggested its replacement with the compulsory use of biometric passports by third country citizens not requiring a visa when entering the EU.
At the moment, we have only a vote planned without the opportunity to submit any amendments to Mr Lehne's report.
It is time for the EU to take action and to show solidarity with the Icelanders.
These unifying measures do not really involve restricting the sovereignty of Member States.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with today's vote, we have given a further boost to the - how should I put it - definitive solution to this problem, but we have not adopted the best possible solution.
I do understand the situation depicted by the co-authors of the oral question, but unfortunately, I cannot give them any other answer, so we need to leave it to Latvia itself to take care of this problem, which the Union is not in a legal position to resolve.
Written statements (Rule 142)
The stocks, particularly the eastern stock in the Mediterranean, remains critically low and there is a very real risk that we will soon witness the extinction of this endangered species.
We call for military escorts to be provided, because that is the most effective solution and also the cheapest and the one recommended by the International Maritime Organisation.
The motto chosen by the Hungarian Presidency is thus a very appropriate and good one.
However, it aims to adopt a mechanism that was not included in the compromise text from the Council, as the text caused difficulties with implementation in the Member States.
Let us not forget that before we construct new rules we need to stick to the most fundamental rules, but let me also point to some other things.
in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report. Migration is a particularly relevant issue which has been highlighted recently, because due to events in North Africa, the European Union, as a neighbouring region, has been forced to receive huge flows of migrants.
in writing. - (DE) The rapporteur is opposed to a Convention, because the treaty changes are only transitional measures.
That is not a matter for the EU.
The EU is an area of solidarity and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is part of that.
11.
There have been very few discordant voices disagreeing with that conclusion.
Faced with enormous delays to the project, and because of all the problems and difficulties encountered, the Council decided to carry out two 'milestone' tests: the first in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the second in summer 2010.
The EU cannot impose an exact replica of our internal legislative measures on third countries, just as third countries, to which we export, cannot impose their own national rules on us.
Let us create coherent, efficient, professional legislation in response to the financial crisis.
Therefore, tomorrow, in the course of a trialogue, the Commission is going to present the modalities for discussion and how we can agree the conciliation technicalities before starting the real procedure for 2011.
Integrated programmes with adequate funding under a separate budget line are needed, programmes which focus on combating youth unemployment, which is extremely high in Greece in particular, with one in four young people under the age of 25 out of work.
(IT) Mr President, I was unsure as to how to vote on Mrs Schaldemose's report on the integrity of online gambling and for what reason. So I asked my pensioners.
The current state of affairs is pretty much a mixed picture, as Joost Lagendijk, the chair of the European Parliament Delegation to the EU-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee, described it.
Thus it is indispensable for the EIB to focus on supporting projects which directly or indirectly result in an increase of security and the security of supply.
This agreement is heading in the right direction: it is still not enough but the report clearly points out these shortcomings, yet offers us some hope for the future.
They want new priorities and a reduced budget; I say to them that going down this route will mean that they end up with a reduced budget and fewer priorities.
That is why the Democratic Movement MEPs regret the Commission's refusal to include the maritime sector in the EU emissions trading systems.
It has also been agreed, in this regard, that there must be no increase in laboratory use.
I do not dispute the usefulness and necessity of some level of dialogue.
We want to make full use of the European Council as the body in which we can coordinate both Union and national instruments to improve our economic performance.

Libya puts pressure on London and Edinburgh.
On CCCTB, this report says; 'Recalls that the introduction of a CCCTB would help to tackle - within the EU - double taxation and transfer price issues within consolidated groups' I welcome the Irish Government's proposal in this year's Irish Finance Bill to regulate transfer pricing by transnational corporations.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pleasure that I am participating in this debate in plenary on your report, Mr Obiols i Germà.
It is not acceptable to say now that this problem is not our business.
Following the Commission's advice, the decision was taken, both by Council and by Mr Simpson as rapporteur with the backing of the Transport Committee, not to make any substantive changes to the guidelines.
In Italy, it is very useful for combating the Mafia and recently, it has been used to incriminate President Berlusconi for the alleged crimes of bribery and underage prostitution.
I therefore call on the Council to make sufficient refinancing of harvests and food stocks its number one priority.
Member of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I obviously comprehend and fully share the general sentiments expressed in the House - sentiments of criticism and frustration, of course.
on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, my Group and I welcome this opportunity to debate the issues and problems which Europe faces in the area of migration and the Schengen system.
This is where we are now.
This motion is primarily about empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts.
There are sufficient guarantees built into the present proposal and in the additional amendment by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, which we will be backing.
As I mentioned, there were many more people requesting the floor than we were actually able to accommodate.
in writing. - I abstained on the Bullmann report.
There are reams of pages of rules, accompanied by an extensive inspection procedure.
I propose to the Commissioner that we must do a lot more.
This is why I am quoting an example from my country - from Hungary - where the Finance Minister filed criminal proceedings against a journalist because he did not like what he was writing about him.
While registration at a purely intra-state level is subject to the same regulatory requirements as registration within the framework of European processes, the regulatory requirements for changes to registration have not, however, been unified.
However, in Europe, we do not speak with one voice.
(DE) Madam President, Mr Oettinger, in the bank stress tests, as we know, the leeway given was so generous that almost all the institutions investigated were able to come out of the tests relatively well.
The next item is the debate on:
Currently, too many young people are dropping out of school too early and not enough are taking advantage of higher education.
We need practical action such as investigations, including within the government.
However, this instrument has also come about because you have made a personal effort, in part in the face of opposition from the German Government and your partners in the Christian-Democratic Union in Germany, to ensure that it was able to happen.
These are fundamental principles of the European Union and constitute a common basis for the development of the Euro-Mediterranean area.
With regard to the report under examination, a number of Members have proposed strengthening the part on building.
Secondly, I invite you to also be ambitious in terms of the form, because the Swedish Presidency is most probably going to clear the way for Lisbon, which firstly means that there will no longer be that double procedural framework of the third and first pillars, which is often confusing.
Korea is a serious market.
(HU) Thank you very much, Mr President.
If antibiotics were not used, animal diseases and epizootics could quickly spread and become epidemics, causing enormous economic damage.
In fact, there have been consultations on the future of the Lisbon strategy at least since 2008.
Is there not perhaps a conflict of interests?
Furthermore, the economic crisis - I would insist on this point - requires not a national response but a European response.
We also support the call for the Commission to take steps to ensure that the composition of both this committee and the planned new advisory committee on public/private partnerships is balanced, including trade unionists and representatives of the business community, in particular, SMEs, and that they work in a transparent manner.
This news will certainly be received gladly.
The Commission will publish all opinions on draft permit decisions pursuant to Article 10(1) of the Directive, and on draft decisions of transfer pursuant to Article 18(2).
Is there an overview of how much medication is currently stored in Europe and how much could be produced in the event of an outbreak?
But bringing this closer to home - specifically to bureaucrats and politicians in this House - it is now obvious to me that no matter how long you live, you simply do not learn!
Mismanagement is disappointing to many farmers, ownership rights are unclear, enormous basic taxes have to be paid to corrupt governments.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (HU) Mrs Fischer Boel, I think Katerina Batzeli's report and Surján László's opinion are technically sound and politically very correct.
I refer in particular to the points concerning violence against women and the need for education from the earliest years about discrimination against them.
(Applause)
Therefore, colleagues, I encourage you to support Amendment 25, which proposes to impose sanctions on 60 Russian officials involved in the case until a proper investigation of the death of Sergei Magnitsky is conducted.
Today the EU is Ukraine's main trading partner; by 2006, the volume of trade between Ukraine and the Member States of the EU had already reached EUR 26.6 billion.
Thirdly, I would like to point out that this is especially important for island territories, which are all external borders of the European Union, and therefore, they are very vulnerable in terms of security to illegal trafficking and also to threats from globalisation.
Please ensure that all European laws have to pass through this Parliament in a public vote.
Mr President, I would like to thank all the rapporteurs for their constructive cooperation.
The future EIT must be complementary and must not compete with initiatives already carried out at European level in the field of research and innovation.
We must also utilise every single resource to free up the growth potential of our economy.
It is essential to encourage and facilitate young people's access to the agri-food sector in order to promote generation change and ensure the dynamism of the sector.
The question is whether consumers really want to know where all the ingredients in their foods come from or whether there is actually a protectionist agenda at work here.
Thank you once again.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament defends freedom of speech throughout Europe - including in Cologne, since Cologne is part of Europe - for anyone who wants to speak out against fundamentalism and Islamic totalitarianism, whose ideological basis is not Islam, but the fundamentalist Islam of terrorism.
I agree with the draftsmen that the Lisbon Strategy will be successful only if it draws on human resources in an environment that is favourable and conducive to learning, knowledge, science, research, culture, information and innovation.
As things stand in Greece, nobody trusts anyone, least of all the government.
With Ukraine the aim is democracy, a market economy, consolidation of the orientation towards Europe while with Belarus the aim is the democratisation of the country.
To strengthen this credibility and to diffuse any doubts about double standards, the EU should make it absolutely clear that relations with our Eastern neighbours must be grounded, first and foremost, on democratic values, respect for human rights and the rule of law.
We are encouraging twinning exercises and of course we provide our own expertise for Croatia.
We should develop - based on the ECOFIN road map - the way the supervisors work in Europe, but also we should remember the global scale of things.
Judge Bruguière explained this in his in camera intervention filmed before this Parliament in November.
Even though the situation has improved slightly under the influence of the new president, American foreign policy has very little interest in multilateral organisations.
We share the view that the crisis is serious and must be tackled.
There would have to be a consensus here on their optimum conditions of use, however.
Thirdly, with intervention grain stocks at an alarming low and the ratio with usage being totally out of kilter, there urgently needs to be action to address that balance.
During 2006, 13 draft recommendations were made.
There are still hurdles to be overcome, no doubt about that.
In this case, we have not managed to do that to a satisfactory extent.
Will you not also be forced, in the near future, to control internet access prices at European level?
Furthermore, if the concerns of the public in this regard are not to be taken seriously, what about those of the President of the European Council?
Unfortunately, the European Commission has made no progress with these proposals, but it is well known that tax evasion and tax fraud are estimated to cost some EUR 250 billion per year in Europe, which would be enough to cut the public deficits without the need to raise taxes.
I think that the proposals tabled by the European Commission will, in terms of strengthening relations between both continents, facilitate the adoption of a specific action plan during the Summit.
I would really like to thank Parliament, in particular, the two rapporteurs, Ms Bauer and Ms Hedh, the shadow rapporteurs and all the others who made it possible to reach an agreement.
It is indeed difficult to think of any reason not to support the proposed directive with the amendments tabled by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality.
That question is therefore rejected as is the possibility of a reply.
Such events undeniably instil optimism about the future of our common European project.
That is what sometimes makes it so cumbersome and also so difficult to understand.
Thank you once again, President Barroso.
Mr President, very briefly, I do not think you actually followed the Rules of Procedure correctly during the earlier voting session.
(PL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have to bear in mind that Georgia is a small country, albeit situated in an extremely strategic position in the Southern Caucasus, a fact which causes a situation of conflict with its powerful northern neighbour, Russia.
Now, people could rightly say that the Brandenburg Gate had become the gate of freedom.
The second matter I wish to draw your attention to is the situation regarding Romania and Bulgaria, which is something that has already been mentioned here.
Thank you very much, Madam President.
I would like to point out that members of the Tibetan community organised this process with the aim of making their institutions democratic.
Time after time, the Union reveals itself as unable to anticipate China's development adequately.
Here too, though, we would like to see more initiatives from the Commission.
Since the 2005 reform, excessive deficits have been corrected, with currently only the UK and Hungary subject to the excessive-deficit procedure.
You see, Mr Susta, your report comes just at the right moment.

In these circumstances, the Commission does not see the need for any premature legislative intervention.
The holiday season will begin in a few months and we certainly do not want to again experience problems similar to the collapse of the SkyEurope company last year.
Therefore, all measures at all levels, from local to European, must be consistent with this objective.
I have already mentioned the statements of the Ministers for Sport regarding the Olympic Games.
As a German I have to say that I find the conduct of the German Government cynical.
Consequently, I fully support the idea of an EU environmental taxation system, which will inevitably have to be uniform amongst the Member States.
I think that this is an important condition for developing new skills and their self-awareness of their European identity.
One thing we learnt during 2007 was that our quota system did not allow supply to meet demand.
In addition, the EIB must align its external activities with the European consensus on development.
(HU) During this cycle the European Parliament has had the task of exercising control over the administration of an ever-increasing number of agencies, a fact also mentioned by my fellow Member, Mr Fjellner.
These blasphemy laws in a society in which freedom of expression is repressed in the name of religion pose another risk; last Wednesday, a court in Pakistan banned the social networking site Facebook in the country.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, very briefly in reply to what Mr van Nistelrooij asked, yes, we have been working with the Dutch Government for the last year-and-a-half on this.
Another important point is the recommendation for the development of a global system of food stocks and emergency reserves.
When will you waken up?
At the same time, however, financing for fossil fuel projects has risen by 430%.
The debate is closed.
That problem needs to be solved and the report makes some important suggestions here.
To begin with, I had hoped it would be eradicated without my having to learn how to pronounce it, but unfortunately it is becoming persistent so we now have to discuss the issue.
However, I still believe that these instruments are only economically beneficial and favourable for a few central transit European Union Member States, and therefore completely unfavourable or much less favourable for a large number of European Union Member States, situated near the European Union's borders, both in the east, the south, the west and the north.
Session musicians will benefit from a permanent 20% levy.
rapporteur. - Mr President, I am delighted to be able to open our debate today on my report about emissions from light commercial vehicles (LCVs).
I want to mention the ratings agencies as well, and the accounting rules which Mrs Berès also mentioned - the fair value issue.
Since SOLVIT was established in 2002, its workload has been growing exponentially year on year, so much so that in 2008, there was an increase of 22% of cases coming before it, leading to 1 000 cases, and with an 88% resolution saving EUR 32.6 million.
This includes monitoring and evaluation.
You see: there it is.
It has been a very constructive and harmonious debate - apart, I suppose, from the intervention of one compatriot who allowed his mixture of gross exaggeration and overstatement, tinged with a fair amount of ideological prejudice, totally to misrepresent what is being envisaged and proposed.
Mrs McGuinness has just been speaking about contented mothers who are also able to bestow contentment on their children.
So, between these two extremes, what should we do?
In other words, we obviously need to review these security mechanisms, because they were clearly insufficient for preventing an attack such as the alleged Detroit attack, which fortunately did not take place.
Navigation for the blind, planning the most accessible routes for the disabled, assistance for those suffering from Alzheimer's disease, or rapid location of people in emergency situations are all examples of applications geared towards improving lifestyles.
Where there is European supervision, national momentum comes to a standstill.
The UCITS Directive has become a huge brand globally.
I do not know whether Mr Piebalgs will still be a Commissioner and will still be responsible for this area, but I hope that the Commission is also of the opinion that we must ensure that all budget appropriations that cannot be disbursed are transferred in other areas to employment-related projects concerned with energy efficiency and energy security.
I welcome Montenegro's membership of the European Union as soon as possible.
Iran must live up to its international obligations and treat detained persons in accordance with international human rights standards.
The minister who decided on cavalier distribution of EU rural development funds on this basis, leading to the demeaning and bizarre spectacle of farmers queuing for two days to get some of their own modulated money back, is a minister not fit to hold office.
I, of course, welcome the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund to aid the victims of the tragedy that struck Madeira following abnormal rainfall.
Moreover, I totally agree with you that, in order to alleviate the socio-economic impact that will be caused by the reduction in fishing activity, it is necessary to ensure financial compensation for the industry.
The Commission proposed this back in February 2009, and the Council and Parliament have been extremely committed to this.
(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament is about to adopt rules governing international finance.
In principle, an approach based on partnership is preferable to a confrontational one.
As has already been said here, the European Union could use its diplomatic power, impose sanctions, refuse visas, pressurise regional powers and support the defenders of democracy and human rights.
I therefore think it important to emphasise that I fully support the efforts aimed at rendering the work of the European Union's institutions more transparent and establishing a basis for appropriate administrative techniques.
Otherwise, transport will transfer entirely to the road, which would run counter to our aims in terms of reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
Mr Staes has rightly drawn up a very critical report and, after the many improvements seen in recent years, it is now time to throw open the windows once and for all and show the European public by means of this transparency that we are able to handle their money responsibly, as that is what this is all about.
It is very important to me that he also understand why we want this.
Firstly, the use of cluster bombs has an especially inhuman aspect.
One thing is clear: all put ACP development at the centre of EPAs.
What we need are strategic solutions for the past but, above all, for the future.
However, after reading the Court of Auditors' report, I have the impression that one Member State, namely Romania, is responsible for the majority of the remaining irregularities.
In the framework of CFP reform, we have to try to proceed, using the step-by-step approach, to having the same status for the Mediterranean as we do for the other sea basins throughout Europe.
It is actually about providing greater flexibility and it is up to Member States to decide whether and how much they want to allocate to this area.
The improper execution of this construction work will at least have a positive effect for the future, because European law will be worded more clearly and will no longer be so easy to circumvent.
When the OLAF investigation into CDE found that corruption had taken place and that the Commission had failed to exercise due diligence as members of the management board of the CDE at the time the fraud was taking place, one would have expected action and certainly protection for the whistleblowers concerned.
The role of trade unions is to collectively represent the material interests of their members in the workplace, not to decide what political views are acceptable or unacceptable. The Court's decision is yet another European nail in the coffin of British liberties.
in writing. - (PT) I could only vote in favour of this report.
The events in North Africa are also a reminder of how important it is to reduce unilateral dependence and to link up unconnected energy networks.
EU funding in the area of decommissioning nuclear power plants in the new Member States (short presentation)
That is why the discussion on this issue is taking place rather late.
For those, and I am one of them, who think that Europe has an identity, values, the answer is obvious: there is indeed a European cultural identity.
The good solution would have been to stay on the grounds of health and safety in this proposal, and strengthen equal opportunities in a different provision.
Once again they are attacking Cuba and its people, by seeking to meddle in its independence and sovereignty, its economic and social successes and its exemplary internationalist solidarity.
On the one hand, the tabled amendments make the original proposal clearer, which is an improvement, and, on the other, as opposed to the original objectives, they weaken the dissuasive forces seen in the original proposal, especially on the part of the authorities.
Therefore, this amendment adds significantly to the effectiveness of the organisation's structure.
At the same time, however, it will create a common environment and provide a prerequisite for a common, high-quality basis and an efficient approach to training specialists.
This is, first and foremost, a competition between research and other economic sectors.
I believe that it is important to strengthen common European cooperation in combating unfair advertising practices.
Many of us answered, and still answer today, in the negative.
Mr Speroni will now present the amendment.
Mr President, we in Europe must improve the order in our regulations and checks and make appropriate efforts so that safe products are manufactured in China and third countries.
Between these reviews, we can, of course, call on the Member States to take the measures necessary to eliminate discriminatory legislation and ensure that the skilled labour force within the whole of the EU is utilised, but the purely legal aspects are dealt with together with the Commission.
I voted in favour.
However, I voted against the draft resolution for a number of reasons.
We have worked for this for many years.
This is no way to construct an international order or implement fair and effective multilateralism.
Written statements (Rule 149)

It is necessary to check whether Union funds are being well used, whether these institutions are meeting the objectives outlined for them, and whether any resources are being wasted.
Who but the European Union could help transform the concept to a more sustainable one?
As a representative of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, I would like to concentrate on your first pillar - growth, jobs and European competitiveness.
Jean Monnet, the founding father of Europe, once said: 'When an idea matches the needs of the time, it ceases to belong to the people who invented it and it is stronger than those who are in control of it', and he added, 'there are no premature ideas, there are opportune moments that you have to know how to wait for'.
(FR) Mr President, first of all something positive, Mr Barroso.
If we go down the path of protectionism because of the world's current financial crisis, the only thing we will do is delay bringing millions of people out of poverty, and millions of people will die.
Serbia has traditionally played an important role in the Western Balkans.
All other national embassies will become redundant.
I am probably talking to you on one of my last occasions here and I would like to thank you for all the cooperation I had, for all the understanding I have had from you right from the very beginning.
With permits being issued in this way, there is a risk that each Member State will set its own permit conditions and the internal market will be disrupted.
There are also the use of land and the many forms of damage to nature and human health.
To achieve these objectives, we need to work together for innovation.
Regarding Poland and the United Kingdom, the protocol clarifies the application of the charter in relation to the laws and initiative action of Poland and of the United Kingdom and its judiciability within these Member States.
We talk about the global footprint, we talk about all this sort of nonsense, despite the fact that the globe has not actually warmed for 10 years - the science is thrown out of the window.
He must now keep that promise.
(Applause)
It is important that the relevant measures which Georgia should take to prevent and combat fraud, corruption and other irregularities relating to this assistance are set out in the memorandum of understanding, the loan agreement and the grant agreement, which will be agreed with the Georgian authorities.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the face of the financial crisis, enormous amounts of money are suddenly being freed up, including sums to ease the economic crisis.
Mr Schulz is right in wanting more Europe in our thinking and new tools for our work, such as a tax on financial transactions, eurobonds, supervision of banks and coordinated budgetary discipline of Member States.
Guarantees of access to technical information are needed.
The international community also needs to be able to keep a distance and let the country's Kosovan and Serb populations build their own model of coexistence.
For example, in December 2008, the Commission adopted a communication, 'Towards an EU Strategy on Invasive Species'.
The fact is that the European Union is imperfect and incomplete.
We have battled for it to be established and there is no question today of it being abandoned or being thrown out.
I therefore call on the Commission to develop a broad, multiannual action plan against AMR within the framework of the EU animal health strategy (2011-2015).
That role should remain with the appropriate governing body.
I think we did a good job.
As a Member of Parliament representing a constituency very much affected by cross-border issues, and as someone who comes from the only region in France which shares a border with three other EU Member States, I take a great interest in these issues and in projects for cross-border cooperation.
I voted for Amendments 33 and 223 because I consider that the liberalisation of the sector should not be abrupt, and I rejected Amendments 314, 347, 293 and 217 because I do not agree with the introduction of the possibility of continuing the procedure of enrichment with sugar, a practice that could cause imbalances between producers, and I therefore support the European Commission's original text here.
However, we fully support the move to ensure that a series of offences can no longer go unpunished.
We are also talking about the ambitious Europe 2020 strategy being prepared by the Commission and we are talking about combating unemployment and poverty.
Neither Jobbik - The Movement for a Better Hungary - nor the Hungarian Guard has ever committed any crime - anyone can easily check this out - and has never defied any law, and therefore this is simply part of neoliberal political propaganda which tries to show them in a bad light, for neither the Hungarian Guard nor members of Jobbik have ever come into any conflict with the law, and we intend to continue to act in accordance with the law.
For it to be a success, the initiative must genuinely come from citizens.
How patronising is that?
Relations between the European Union and Mauritania are very important for the European Parliament.
Then, of course, considerable time will pass before we can again sit here and decide whether to adopt some common position.
I voted for the report on the proposal for a regulation laying down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the European Union.
But in the end, you know, the Member States decide on the funding for research.

Mr President, I am grateful that we are able to debate this topic today, as it is such an important one.
It became clear that the parties would propose laying the foundations for establishing a strategic partnership.
The transition to a safe and sustainable low carbon economy will influence numerous policies including the economy and people's everyday lives.
(EL) Mr President, I should like to point out that the Balkans are trying today, as they did for the whole of the 20th century, to strike a balance between the difficult heritage of nationalism and the need for common European prospects in the immediate future.
The Mikolášik report is deserving of support.
In the short run, steps must be taken to deal with an economic slowdown in Tokyo and with the likely consequences for the countries most closely linked to Japan.
The Commission wants to conclude the draft Directive on cross-border health services tomorrow.
As regards our amendment, which is often misunderstood, it is, of course, the case that bilateral problems should not form part of the negotiation framework.
Finally, I would like to ask the Commission if it still has the full support of the Member States for this project.
International organisations, national services and specialised organisations, such as the International Grains Council, produce detailed data on this subject.
The objective of MDG 5 is to reduce the ratio of women dying in childbirth by three quarters between 1990 and 2015.
In this respect, the Commission's proposal is aimed primarily at extending maternity leave from 14 to 18 weeks, increasing maternity benefits to enable women to interrupt their jobs and look after their children while feeling financially secure, and providing the greater flexibility that should be given to women in terms of arranging their maternity leave and the work conditions for their return to employment.
The Indian Government is not doing anything effective to guarantee human rights in this country, particularly the right to life and the right to freedom of belief.
I congratulate you in particular, Mr Frattini, as the competent Commissioner for this initiative.
I believe that we are capable of managing the scale of investment in renewable energy.
on behalf of the EFD Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, despite being a Eurosceptic, I could be in favour of a plan, in view of the 2020 Strategy, to eliminate discrimination, difficulty and marginalisation if we were really being offered incisive action by the European Commission to control the behaviour of Member States.
The Green Paper offered a consultation ...
That is why the report mentions that social and environmental clauses should be included in all free trade agreements signed by the Union.
Women should not feel that having children is incompatible with their work - our policies need to enable care for younger and older persons.

I am familiar with the disastrous financial situation of many Member States and I believe that some of them need time to decide what should be done.
If we maintain the spirit of cooperation which we have today, I hope that we will solve all our problems.
I also hope that, with the support and good offices of the Commission, we can then start conciliation and build a compromise acceptable to both branches of the legislature.
President of the Commission. - The election in Parliament was an open election.
The EU would do well not to overestimate the significance of this.
Agenda: see Minutes
If, however, they die in defence of values such as freedom or truth, we can say that their suffering is not in vain - as is the case with the recent victims in Iran.
I would like to emphasise strongly that, even in this crisis - and specifically in this crisis, in fact - European manufacturers must not slacken off when it comes to developing and bringing onto the market cars that meet the requirements of the early 21st century, and those requirements are quite clear.
Finally, allow me to add that it is imperative that we pay due attention to future generations, that we promote the exchange of students within the framework of the Union for the Mediterranean and that we support EMUNI University, the participation of senior institutions and higher education and cultural fora.
Italy has received them.
I have also been briefed on the rapporteur's speech.
This is to say that I strongly support the resolution.
Let us all fight together on this!
The company concerned, Millstream Recycling, are cooperating fully.
We are all aware that the agri-sector is beset by low margins, and the least, I think, that EU farmers can expect is that the cost of inputs should not be increased by the failure of the EU to act sufficiently quickly to establish authorisations.
In my view, it constitutes a new legislative power within the European institutions placed in the hands of the citizens.
Israel accepted some of these points, and, in the negotiations with the Israeli Government, I also secured the co-location of an ECHO official in the Israeli Defence Force premises to coordinate the channelling of humanitarian aid with the Israeli armed forces, as had been done in the war in Lebanon, and that was a powerful tool for better coordination.
The French Presidency has a tremendous amount of respect and admiration for the work that you have done in support of European integration, and the best possible proof of our willingness to help Europe move forward together was provided by the French President in his speech in Strasbourg in July.
That is the object of the 'General Affairs and External Relations' Council decision of 17 November 2007.
This is crucial in avoiding the proliferation of weapons.
The joint motion for a resolution by the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe on the EU 2020 strategy expresses the joint decision by the political face of capital to use every means to implement the savage attack and anti-grassroots plans of the monopolies against the working classes and workers throughout the EU.
A fast-track procedure will be used by the Commission to ensure a rapid decision.
Grouping together and simplifying all the existing legislation on indications or marks will facilitate controls and the identification of any illegal practice.
The next item is the Commission statement on Economic partnership agreements.
After all, Israel is a democratic country, which faces an existential threat from Jihadi terrorists and their cheerleaders, who are the very individuals currently held under administrative detention by Israel.
Now, Madam President, having given out the presents and taken stock, I would like to turn to the challenge that we are going to have to face together and the new guidelines that should inspire the Stockholm programme, which I sincerely hope can be implemented on the basis of the Treaty of Lisbon, should it finally be ratified.
The own-initiative report offers useful and widely shared suggestions for achieving the aim of an agricultural sector that combines quality and competitiveness.

Secondly, there must be a clear and strict purpose limitation in line with earlier resolutions, and we insist that data be used only for law-enforcement and security purposes and on the basis of very precise definitions of what that is: organised international crime and international terrorism.
A few days ago Russia, without the consent of Georgia, increased its military contingent in Abkhazia from two to three thousand soldiers and also appointed a high-ranking Russian officer to command the so-called Abkhazian army staff.
This is something that I am also constantly trying to do, namely to keep dioxins from incineration out of the food chain.
We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will still vote in favour, as we want to take our place in a majority that at least rescues the principle of the charging of external costs for a future where more reasonable people occupy the role of transport minister in the Member States.
I voted against this report because the rapporteur's initial proposal has been distorted, and positions have been included that urge the application of measures that were at the root of the crisis.
Our actions foster the growth of radical, anti-Western Islamic beliefs.

This will allow us to approve a satisfactory move towards banning the export of mercury by a very large majority.
I do not have time to go into details.
It has already become clear that the present system, under which substances on the list are to be examined and new ones added, at best works too slowly.
author. - Madam President, recital E should read as follows: 'whereas the United Nations refugee agency has voiced its concern about the reports of mistreatment of the Burmese refugees and gained access to some of the 126 Rohingya still kept in custody by the Thai authorities'.
It is Mr Putin who is bringing about this deterioration in the rule of law.
It is not just one or two governments that have demanded this; many more have requested it.
Thank you.
Perhaps they did not enjoy the great media attention prompted by 10 000 US marines arriving on the island, but everything took place very quickly and effectively in my opinion, and I have plenty of experience.
I therefore fully agree that these forms of training at the workplace should be used properly and should not replace regular jobs, as was highlighted by several speakers.
There are, of course, outstanding questions.
Innovation partnerships (
We have to make sure that research facilities are available in Europe so we do not lose people abroad.
I would define Mr Borghezio's activities as provocation, and on behalf of the Confederal Group of the United European Left/Nordic Green Left, I would like to make a formal request for the President of Parliament to issue an official warning to Mr Borghezio.
I wanted to make that absolutely clear.
It is wholly different from the system which exists in most of continental Europe.
The motion is timely: free trade negotiations with South Korea were launched in May 2007, and have progressed rapidly so far.
We cannot protect ourselves against these large companies unless our legislators help us.
Unfortunately, this period is coinciding with a general economic crisis and the decline in the population's purchasing power is also affecting livestock production.
In view of all this, the rapporteur, having recognised this problem, managed to secure the acceptance of a broadly supported compromise which determined the basis of the collection targets not by the quantity of products placed on the market but by the quantity of electronic waste generated.
Therefore, whatever the Commissioner's reasons may have been, I certainly stand behind the Ombudsman.
That is why, in the interests of professionals, I call on the European Commission to help those Member States that are having difficulties.
in writing. - Mrs Aubert's report on the Community system against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is a report that I generally support.
There will be an opportunity for this next month at the 15th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in Doha.

However, legally binding safeguards will ensure that absolutely no data are accessed unless there is an objectively verified reason to believe that an identified person is a terrorist, a suspected terrorist, or is financing terrorism and that those data transfers are anonymous.
A number of amendments also usefully clarify or complement the Commission's proposal, in particular as regards the role of the network operator, the powers of national regulators and an effectively well-functioning and secure internal energy market.
Thirdly, we need to avoid a situation where Member States are acting separately.
I do not underestimate the difficulties in getting between here and Copenhagen in 2009; besides other matters - the rainforest issue and the technological transfer - there are all sorts of hurdles in the way.
A resolution was adopted, expressing the intense concern generated by the situation in Zimbabwe, and emphasising the critical reports drawn up by electoral observers from the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the African Union and the Pan-African Parliament, and the violence and loss of life.
Concerning the electricity regulation, I would like to make clear that this regulation plays a crucial role, since it gives Member States the tools needed to significantly increase interconnection capacity within the Union by the development and establishment of binding network codes to be applied by all transmission system operators to exchanges, thus removing one of the main physical barriers to the completion of the internal electricity market.
If these are then thrown straight into the bin without being properly dealt with and without the proper follow-up, then we have probably done democracy in Europe a disservice.
I do not want to repeat the points that have been raised already, but I would like just to draw attention to a few particular issues.

What is absolutely clear is that the opt-out has nothing to do with flexibility.
In 2008, the EU undertook to cut energy consumption by 20%, as well as to ensure that 20% of the energy consumed comes from renewable sources by 2020.
However, it is an acceptable part of the energy mix of a number of countries.
The time has come when we have to take up this important role.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I should have been rapporteur on this dossier, so I feel a bit disappointed.
The Charter is not merely a text; it is there to be put into practice. And if it is not put into practice, the elected representatives of the people will say so loud and clear.
Moreover, it was emphasised that if the Commission intends to present a regulation of this kind in the future, it must first produce a report proving that such a measure will be effective.

Equally important, we will demonstrate to our citizens that we understand and can respond to their day-to-day concerns.
Madam President, I see a silver lining in this awful cloud for Japan - namely that the rebuilding and restoration work in that country, courtesy of the deep pockets of the insurance industry, should give a huge boost to their economy and that will be good for the rest of the world.
On the other hand, however, we must avoid the pitfall of making emotional and unfounded decisions about whether to keep or abandon nuclear energy.
Or did you?
Similarly to Lithuania's construction sector, which we have analysed before, that country's furniture industry has also felt the effects of globalisation, as it is now exposed to the products of vicious competitors, whose production is on another level.
There was no terror in Libya?
Within this framework, I welcome the rapporteur's proposal for a special plan to be prepared as soon as Bulgaria joins the Schengen area, containing actions in this direction and a joint approach between Greece, Turkey and Bulgaria, so that it is in a position to cope with what may be a large increase in immigration flows.
A bit of consistency would be to the European Union's credit.
I therefore voted against this report.
It is very important that we have new structures, especially in the field of foreign and security policy, and I agree with those people who have stressed the importance of good common foreign and security policy, but it is not enough just to have good structures in place.
Culture, like all historical phenomena, is not founded on any homogenous and shared identity: quite the contrary, it is the expression of antagonisms, conflicts and situations of cultural domination.
As you will remember, the winner is the Cuban dissident Guillermo Fariñas.
The vote will take place during the March I part session.

I am also one of those people, however, who believe that we must continue with the ratification process; every Member State has the same right to express its opinion on the common future of Europe.
The mitigation measures of both developed and developing countries have now been included and embedded in the text, which is very important, because the outcome of Copenhagen has now also been officially included.
It was brought to my attention just a little while ago and it contains many shocking references, one of which is about a girl waiting to be hanged named Ameneh Salam from a village in Naqadeh whose crime is that she became pregnant without being married.

A letter was written by Elena Bonner, the widow of Andrei Sakharov, to Nicholas Bethel's family a few days ago, in which she recognised that, without his help, the cause of Sakharov and many other dissidents in the then Soviet Union - and the nature of the repressive regime - would not have been properly recognised outside.

Hopefully, things will never get that bad again.
Congratulations on the end result, because that is also what the Committee on International Trade had pleaded for.

We want to fill the gap of democratic legitimacy after all the pain we witnessed when the referenda were held.
The Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing has been concluded, under the aegis of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), and it requires European Parliament approval to be permanently binding for the Union, so I voted in favour of concluding this agreement, as it is a central point of the common fisheries policy.

Madam President, I would like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Weisgerber, and the shadows for producing this report and negotiating a very good agreement with the Council and the Commission, while preserving Parliament's priorities.

Lastly, there is the problem of the International Criminal Court.
The problem is the unchecked rise in the price of oil, the increasing demand from a number of countries with rapidly growing economies, regional disturbances in oil-producing countries, as well as the fact that renewable sources of energy or natural gas will cover a mere fraction of Europe's energy needs.

'However, the position followed by the Commission in this file shall not be considered as a precedent.
An in-depth assessment of European environmental economic accounts can only be made on the basis of reliable data and therefore, Member States should be equipped with common methodology and standards, definitions, classifications and accounting rules which should be developed in a framework which is binding on all States.
Moves to simplify the business environment are therefore to be welcomed.
The President of the Council has given us a very detailed report.

The June List would observe that it is just as well that the European Parliament does not have codecision powers in the EU's agricultural policy, because the Union would then fall into a trap of protectionism and heavy subsidies for all the different groups in the agriculture sector.
We can see that by the end of 2010, about 100 000 SMEs received some form of bank guarantee within the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP), which is a huge number, but for 23 million enterprises, this is very little.
How can the bank be allowed to put pressure on people with a mortgaged house in the affected area, asking them to pay what they owe, since their houses have lost value?
These must of course be environmentally friendly.
It is not acceptable that in 2010, industry accounts for only 14% of GDP in prominent Member States.

These strategies must sometimes allow for intervention in certain areas of the world, open doors to a given country, or establish trust relationships in certain areas of the world.

Of course, I must stress that this debate should not be used as an excuse to criticise either Bulgaria or Romania, who we know have been working very hard to meet the technical criteria that the Commission has set.

It has nothing to do with the war on terror, the controversial concept used by the Chinese Government as a justification for their repressive treatment of the Uighurs in East Turkestan.
When these issues are being discussed, Parliament is not prepared to look the other way and content itself with the kind of general reassurances that the Council provided during the negotiations.
As one of these countries, Belarus, is in Europe, we feel it necessary to make every effort to achieve the abolition of the death penalty throughout the world, given that it is the most cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment and violates the right to life set down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

In the meantime it has emerged that Minister Petkov had been in communication with criminal elements on a regular basis and even met with such individuals.

I voted in favour of adopting this report, which lays down guidelines for the 2012 budget procedure: a general framework and budgetary priorities for the functioning of the European institutions (except the European Commission).
The subject of this report is very relevant, since we know that the EU's policies and actions in several areas frequently contradict stated 'development aid' objectives.

Innovation can be most effectively addressed at regional level by the proximity of entities such as universities, public research organisations or industry, promoting partnerships in the field of knowledge transfer, and the exchange of best practice between regions.

in writing. - (LT) I abstained from the vote on this document, although the audit of the Court of Auditors states that, as regards administrative expenditure in 2009, all the institutions satisfactorily operated the supervisory and control systems required by the Financial Regulation and the transactions tested were free from material error. The Secretary-General also certified, on 2 July 2010, his reasonable assurance that Parliament's budget has been implemented in accordance with the principles of sound financial management and that the control framework put in place provides the necessary guarantees as to the legality and regularity of the underlying operations.
In this respect, as pointed out by Parliament and by Members already, it is important that examination of the seven proposals of the Third Maritime Safety Package is accelerated.
I support this idea.
They have refused to do it in the past.
And today, when we recall that you too, Mr President, come from my country, a country which has suffered so much at the hands of totalitarianism, we know one thing - and this truly is the best thing about the EU - the European Union has ensured the nations of Europe 60 years without war.

Does the Commission believe that it could assist the fishing fleet in these regions by helping to preserve fish stocks in these areas?

We wait with hope for the final ratifications of the treaty.
We must certainly change our agricultural policy; it must be linked to ecological energy generation.
It must be clear that this is a European force involving several European nations.
The Community Code on Visas is necessary to render more uniform the processing of short-stay Schengen visas and, above all, to improve visa-issuing service and thus the perception of the European Union in third countries.
I agree with everything the rapporteur said and I would highlight the fact that, nowadays, energy policy has far more to do, directly and indirectly, with the foreign policy in general both of the Member States and of the Union itself.
One of the areas of such action, at European level, is protection and improvement of human health (Article 2E).
It would also be possible, however, to regard the Afghan and Iranian cases as a single issue of 'individuals facing the threat of death'.

One of them is the advice, information and guidance given to young people and employees of every age to enable them to find suitable employment, education and lifelong learning.
Mr President, Tunisia, Egypt and Malaysia have a great tradition of tolerance.
Persuading this largest emitter to take on common obligations may lead to a global understanding in Poznań and Copenhagen, and it is only when we succeed in reaching such an understanding that our programme to limit emissions will not have been squandered.
We have said many times that we do not accept human rights violations.
I therefore cannot understand why you are now lowering yourself to the same practices.
Mr President, as chair of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I welcome today's important debate as a first step in reviewing Europe's consumer policy and, I believe, in renewing our commitment to our consumers.
This point has already been made by Mrs Herranz in relation to the promotion of European wines within and outside Europe.
We voted against this report, in keeping with all our earlier positions relating to the infamous Bolkestein Directive and its unacceptable aims of facilitating the liberalisation of services, including public services, to favour the interests of economic and financial groupings within the European Union, at a cost of increased unemployment and inferior services provided to the respective users, as is already plainly visible within sectors that have gone down this road.
We all agree that climate change can be a win-win situation, where we can solve environmental problems and where we can create new jobs.
The Czech Presidency also recognised the significance of this dossier, and I think we achieved a sound result, not least for everyone who wants to move freely in Europe.

In the UK, women still account for under 20% of the Members of Parliament, nearly half of the companies in the FTSE 250 have no females in the boardroom at all, and only a fifth of all engineering, science and IT graduates are women.
There is therefore, a clear difference.
The reason of course is to try and cover up the regime of enormous corruption which exists in that country.
A somewhat harsh winter that did not allow many days' fishing and the scarce support available for fishermen staying on shore forced them to go to sea in adverse conditions.
But I do so with the knowledge that Turkey has an important role to play, and I do so in the knowledge that I represent 27 Member States, and I work closely with the Member States who are most interested and affected by the issues at hand.

This fellow Member was elected by a democratic decision of the people to be President of his country.

The last session, as you are aware, was on 20 November last year in Beijing.
When I talk to researchers across Europe, I hear about unattractive working conditions and career prospects, an often precarious status and short-term contracts.

Afterwards, we will inform - on a concrete and permanent basis - the Fisheries Committee in Parliament about the negotiations.
I might point out that only 6% of the production costs of new cars are staff costs.
Motherhood in particular has an impact on women's career opportunities, paradoxically punishes them in terms of the opportunity to get to top positions, fulfil themselves and be justly rewarded, and does not offer them adequate compensation for the social investment of giving birth to and bringing up children who will be responsible for tomorrow.
The economic crisis has not left the country untouched.
This would be unlikely to have any major impact outside Poland's borders.

I will insist, when I chair at least, that Members conduct themselves in a civil way with each other, and I will try to keep the time as best I can.
It is important, moreover, that the Commission should use information campaigns to help make sure that all those who may be at risk should be aware of their rights, opportunities and the dangers both within the EU and in third countries, and that it should do everything possible to ensure that Member States duly transpose and implement the relevant European legislation.
I believe we can offer three things.

I do not think that any further amendments or a third reading would bring any significant results.
This would amount to around EUR 3 billion from 2020 onwards for a country like Germany.

Make no mistake, we are fully committed to this issue.
The relocation of the 1.3 million homeless in Port-au-Prince in temporary housing is a very complex undertaking because of practical issues such as land ownership, rubble removal, urban planning and security.

In spite of the clear interest of many Member States in pursuing a framework agreement with Libya, the EU cannot forget the fundamental values it defends and subordinate itself to economic interests only.

It is nice to have her with us.
One of the areas that make the lives of the EU public difficult is the constant amendments to legislation.
(NL) Mr President, I think it was a wise decision to postpone the vote because, although we have the required number of members for a quorum, we do not have the geographical distribution.

The hearings in Parliament produced an unequivocal message.
We are not!
Currently, national statistics are compiled by Member States themselves and the Commission seems to favour making use of that to set up a common framework under a single European Union regulation, option C. So the EC craze to harmonise converts a simple system into a bureaucratic and time-consuming one.
However, it is precisely because this sort of demagoguery exists in our countries that we need to be extremely strict when talking about making decisions relating to money and the perks that we receive.
I believe - President Barroso is not here any more - that his prudence won him his second election.
I therefore feel ashamed to be a citizen of a craven Union, the same one that only a few days ago ignored international law by recognising the independence of Kosovo, just as I was ashamed of the Italian Government and almost all of Italy's political parties - majority and opposition alike - which acceded to China's request not to grant the Dalai Lama an official reception when he visited Italy.

China, India and ASEAN have some influence: their main concerns are the country's stability as well as trade relations and investment.
I would like to thank everyone concerned once again.

This is a cheap, green source of energy and technological progress will make it increasingly safe.

I can only say that it has really been a very exciting and extraordinary period, and it is back again.

A suitable time has also arisen for an in-depth debate here in Parliament.
The target of this foiled attack was police officers in what is the latest in a series of attempts to murder serving officers of the Police Service of Northern Ireland.
I would ask the Commission to look at this as well.
Countries like Portugal are drifting ever further from the promised economic and social development that would move them closer to the EU average.
in writing. - (DE) It makes perfect sense for air transport agreements with the United States to now be concluded at European level instead of separately with individual Member States as they were previously.

It is also important to point out that, unlike the Berès report, these proposals make no positive suggestions that would actually allow us to have genuine economic governance in the European Union.
That is what the Commission is saying to us: 'We are not here.
The Arab countries are our partners; we have no intention of patronising them or imposing anything from the outside.
Parliament knows these articles.

I urge Members to approach these reports pragmatically.
They just do not exist, because they do not form part of the current standard vocabulary of political correctness within these walls.
Failure to declare these activities is detrimental to both the workers and the state, which cannot levy taxes on them.
President Obama's concept of a levy on financial institutions could bear some merit.
If there is one lesson in this crisis that we have to learn above all others, it is that western civilisations must not be dependent on others for their vital energy supplies.
So, Commissioner, we do not just need two Frontex experts but a Frontex mission that must be sent there now.
The whole strategy must not be short-sighted.
Bulgaria, for example, will be facing problems in the future.

The idea of giving developing countries a helping hand and (also) offering them financial support is something to be warmly welcomed.

We have therefore voted against the report.
I therefore consider that the European Parliament is being too hasty and over-stepping its brief in asking that the Regulation on the introduction of liquids onto aircraft should not be implemented unless new proof is produced in support of such implementation.

The protests have spread from Cairo to Alexandria and Suez and further across Egypt and the crowds have continued to grow in size and diversity, with protestors united in their demands for regime change and for the observance of fundamental human rights.
I hope that, owing to the Pinar incident, we all come to understand that while it is easy to shrug off one's responsibility onto others and to accuse each other of wrong doing, the easy path does not lead to solutions.
It is astonishing to note that migration, which is one of the greatest challenges the world has to face, is one area where organisation is lacking on an international level.

This should go hand in hand with a strict asylum policy, one that demonstrates to the rest of the world that Europe is serious about protecting its borders.
It is a lesson from another era that could not work, but the worst part of it is that the situation has become worse, politically and in human terms.
As regards the challenges that we are currently facing, I think the problem does not lie with the Commission, but with the Council.
It is a travesty that the EU decrees, on the one hand, that public contracts must be put out to public tender and that the clause requiring successful tenderers to pay at least the statutory minimum wage is then revoked by the European Court of Justice on the grounds of incompatibility with the directives on services in the internal market and on the posting of workers.

Therefore Parliament has decided: (1) to maintain a common line, i.e. to keep the package of external financial assistance instruments together (including also - so far informally - the IfS); (2) to restore with the EP's second reading amendments the positions adopted by the EP at first reading, i.e. to adopt regarding all external financial assistance instruments the same amendments that were rejected by the Council; and (3) to go for a quick second reading.
What we need today is a world parliament.
Finally, we emphasise the need to redouble our efforts.

It was an excellent piece of work and met with great approval in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
(BG) Mr President, just days ago, the Commission voted for the Danube strategy action plan, so I will look at Mr Luhan's report through the prism of this event, especially since he says in his explanatory statement that his aim is to stimulate debate on the dependency and complementary nature of the measures at European and national level.
Mr President, as we know, only half of the CO2 emissions are covered by the ETS.
In procedural terms, I have called for the Commission to be as flexible as it can under current rules so as to improve our ability to react.

We must return to this debate, as it is by no means over.
Moreover, you have taken away from some commissioners a portfolio with which they had actually proved their worth and you have given them one they are not so happy with.
The initiative that Prime Minister Reinfeldt took today at a meeting with me and with you, President Buzek, and the video conference with Prime Minister Fischer, was a very good and useful initiative.

These were not some negotiations connected with the reaching of an agreement.

(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, let us talk about the reality of car dealers.
The amendment to the legislation on the European Energy Programme for Recovery will make it possible to use the available funds to finance projects including: refurbishing public and private buildings to improve energy efficiency or to switch to renewable energy; constructing renewable energy plants and integrating them into electricity grids; developing clean urban public transport solutions, such as electric and hydrogen vehicles; and developing local infrastructure, including efficient street lighting, electricity storage and the provision of smart metering and smart grids.

I think there is a striking lack of male speakers and I am glad that my group has been able to send two.

No one in this Chamber questions the need for change and the introduction of more comprehensive legislation.
However, this regulation is important for other reasons apart from the voting method - it is important also for all indicators concerning employment, regional, structural or social matters that take account of the data provided by each of the Member States and that, often, in view of the discrepancies in the data collection methods used or in the reference periods, produce inadequate analyses and results of questionable validity.

We have found a compromise.
Thirdly, as well as ensuring that social spending is financially secure through the use of joint contributions and hybrid fund-based solutions, we must put the focus on social investment.

I am sorry that, in view of the development and the complexity of the texts, the Commission has not revised its position dating from 1 April 1987 and consisting of instructing its services to go ahead and codify all legislative acts no later than after their tenth modification while, at the same time, emphasising that this was a minimum rule and that the services were to make efforts to codify the texts for which they were responsible at still shorter intervals.

Only this development will provide a long-term solution to the migratory pressures facing the European Union.
The constant refrain of the lack of press freedom is old news, as are the continuous and anachronistic references to the Italian situation, in which, paradoxically, the major newspapers are controlled by left-leaning media groups and information runs freely, sometimes too freely, on the web.

I would like to suggest to Mr Barrot that here too we should try to settle, and indeed improve, the diplomatic aspects with Gibraltar over maritime safety.

I say this so that the groups will also occupy themselves with this matter.
I believe that the work done by the High Representative Javier Solana, EU enlargement policy, the Barcelona process, the European Neighbourhood Policy just debated here, the EU's special representatives in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Moldova and the Southern Caucasus and the peace process in the Middle East, as well as the EU's role as a member of the Quartet for the Middle East and the Troika for Kosovo, plus the other ESDP missions I have referred to here reflect our determination to create security in our neighbourhood.
How does the Commission view the potential for greater cross-border cooperation between the Serbian province of Vojvodina and eastern Croatia (Osijek/Eastern Slavonia region), with particular regard to the development of cross-border infrastructure such as the project to construct a motorway from Sombor to Osijek?
