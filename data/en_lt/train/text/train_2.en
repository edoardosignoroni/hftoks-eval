As others have said, counterfeiting is often seen as a victimless crime, but of course, as we are discussing, it is far from it. There are at least three groups of losers for counterfeited goods.
Mr President, this so-called Human Rights Council opposes everything that human rights are about, in particular, freedom of expression.
Perhaps it also demonstrates the purpose of what is known as the pilot process, in which we seek to take a first step this year towards a successful system of cooperation between the Bureau and the Committee on Budgets, based on a division of responsibilities and preceded by very intensive discussions with both the Bureau and the parliamentary administration in order to eliminate the sort of misunderstanding and even incomprehension we have frequently experienced.

In addition to the requests to the Member States to carry out investigations, one of the practical contributions made by the Commission, following the European Parliament resolution of 2 February 2007, was to clarify the definition of 'state aircraft' and, when I was Commissioner for Transport, I presented a communication on civil and business aviation that clarified matters.
(PL) Nature has distributed its riches - the raw materials under the ground, the foodstuffs and trees on the earth's surface and the fish in the waters - unevenly across the globe.
The European Commission already drafted principles for strengthening a culture of consultation and dialogue back in 2002, and I therefore hope it will be prepared to draft the appropriate principles.

I myself had the opportunity, during the meeting of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on 22 July, to explain the workings of the TFTP and why we need an interim solution to prevent its interruption.
I agree with the rapporteur that it must be conceived so that it is in harmony with future cohesion policy, and that the 2020 strategy must also be implemented at regional and local level, something that failed to happen with the Lisbon Strategy.

We have expressed a lot of goodwill towards President Obama and commitment to transatlantic relations.

Yet they were called to arms!
It is true that the rapporteur has done a magnificent job but I believe that we should not tackle the group of final amendments on the content of the Net here, in this directive, because in short what those amendments do is allow intermediate service providers to filter and block content on the Net and therefore, ultimately, consumers will lose their anonymity.
Thank you for your attention.
On 26 April 2010, the Committee on Fisheries and the Legal Service of the European Parliament expressed serious doubts about the legal basis chosen by the Commission to draw up the agreement.
It is a fact; it is the reality.
This also applies to sensitive issues outside the remit of Union arrangements, such as the publication of data on passenger movements.
One of the core objectives of the European Union is to have an area without barriers.
By doing so, Europe sets the tone.
The Swedish Presidency of the Council has recognised that, in the current economic crisis, the key priority is that Member States must be able to respond jointly to challenges and find solutions for overcoming the economic and financial crisis and, above all, reducing unemployment and its adverse social consequences.

It also welcomes the European Council decision of 17 December 2010 to grant Montenegro the status of candidate country for accession to the European Union, but regrets, however, the decoupling of candidate status from the right to open negotiations, stressing that the decision to start them should not be unduly or unreasonably postponed, and expects the negotiations to start at the latest after the publication of the 2011 Commission Progress Report, provided Montenegro makes good progress in fulfilling the benchmarks set by the Commission.
Safety of workers and the flexibility required by businesses are extremely important; that is why, today, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats - which is based on these foundations of equal treatment, on access to vocational training, and on the procedures for representing temporary workers in accordance with collective agreements - has sought to make progress with this work, too, and reach a consensus.

Lastly, there is a need to improve the mixing zones and the knowledge of pollutants and sources of pollution, together with the monitoring of emissions.
Finally, my report focuses on those areas which not only require rapid action but also medium to long-term strategies, such as the integration of the Roma, the fight against child poverty and the issue of language use among minority communities, to name but a few.
However, there is currently no consensus between Member States on these tests.

It strikes me about these annual debates on competition policy that there is a very friendly and polite exchange of views, and then the Commission just carries on with business as usual because the Commission has the exclusive powers in this area.

It is up to the Commission to resolve this issue.
I asked the President a question on 19 March.

Mr President, I would like to thank the various speakers who, during the course of this debate, on the one hand have lent their support to the Small Business Act and on the other hand have insisted on rigorous and compulsory monitoring.

In this context, I voted for the creation of a EUR 600 million fund in the budget planned by the EU for 2010 to provide assistance to milk producers, who are currently experiencing a serious crisis, unprecedented within their sector, and are wrestling with the laws of supply and demand on the world dairy market.

(RO) Given that we have a timeframe of 10 years until 2020 and that notable results for reducing greenhouse gas emissions may be achieved in the area of energy performance in buildings and the transport sector, and that we are in the midst of an economic crisis and people are losing their jobs, we must emphasise that the green economy can create millions of jobs.

I can tell you, however, that I believe that the Greek Government, the Commission, the Eurogroup and Ecofin acted swiftly.
Although practical tests at national level have yielded quite positive results, opinions on these vehicles differ.
The two should be linked, not least in order to convince these infamous ministers of finance, who explain to us that perhaps even if the Solidarity Fund criteria were adapted - and you spoke about this - it would cost more.

The Union for Europe of the Nations Group supports the directive.
These are all specific steps, but more are needed if we are to change, first and foremost, our attitude in terms of preventing all forms of discrimination.
This is the case in Pakistan, for example.

I think that the European Union and its Member States must define and implement a principle of 'climate justice' and, therefore, introduce an equity clause in future international climate negotiations.
Some newspaper headlines today read 'Europe puts Italy on trial' or 'Comrade Schulz, Berlusconi's enemy, against Italy'.

The immediate ending of the conspicuous discrimination against non-Islamic minorities when filling important civilian and military posts within the Turkish Government apparatus.

The Commission's proposal on which we are working mainly argues for regional priorities and then, within the regional ones, priorities that I would call 'humanitarian'.
It is right to establish regulations regarding the characteristics required in order for a section of railway to achieve categorisation as a European corridor, because this will help the state and regional authorities to plan, coordinate, and understand each other.

The European Commission figures on this issue are, moreover, very worrying.
President of the European Commission. - I fully agree with you, Mr Marinescu.

According to the text, the instrument is intended to resolve the problems which EU companies have in penetrating certain markets.
For countries like mine, which is a small country in the European Union, to reach a compromise on ownership unbundling is very important, because it gives us an assurance that we can still ensure our energy security within the context of the whole package of the enhanced rules, transparency, the third-country clause, and all the other components of the package that will give us the opportunity to put the issue of energy security at the forefront.
For example, grubbing-up is no longer the main focus of the reform, and I was pleased to hear you say earlier that the Commission is now working with a time frame of three years, as Parliament is requesting, and not five years as you had suggested.

Secondly, on the politics of it, this was the first real vote on climate change.
Thank you for your point.
I thank you, too, for the clear declaration - from a state like Slovenia, a state with your country's history - that you see it as an opportunity for the freedom of your people, because by it you are also sending out a signal against the far right in Europe, which abuses every one of these freedoms with its rhetoric of fear against Europe and makes people afraid of any imponderable developments instead of reassuring them of the opportunities that freedom brings.

I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution on a revised Framework Agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission for the next parliamentary term as it is an important agreement, not only for its symbolic value - given that it gives a clear signal of the commitment of both European institutions, Parliament and the Commission, to work together in pursuit of the European project - but also because of its content, since it identifies the obligations of the parties so that they can better confront the challenges of the future and resolve the problems of the citizenry.

In the meantime, we can advance on concrete issues, such as fast-start finance, reduce emissions from deforestation, and facilitate adaptation to climate change for poor and developing countries.

We must support Baroness Ashton and we must attempt to ensure that the European Union includes a guarantee of religious freedom in all the treaties which it concludes with third countries and, in particular, with the countries we have referred to.

I think you should take that into consideration.

(ES) Mr President, I voted in favour of this initiative in order to condemn the mass human rights violations and the use of rape as a weapon of war against women, boys, girls and babies; in order to ask for those implicated to be held responsible; in order to demand more commitment from the United Nations following the failure of the actions of the United Nations Organisation Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; in order to demand a political solution to the armed conflict, which needs to happen by resuming the dialogue on the peace process; and in order to demand greater commitment from the Great Lakes region to promoting peace and stability in the region.
In light of how much the pound has dropped, I do not even want to imagine what the value of the peseta would be today if we still had that in our wallets.
Despite all the discussions - and particularly in the United Kingdom you have a huge discussion on this with East Anglia and, although the IPCC should be better at correcting errors when they find them - to this day, I have seen nothing that really goes against the main finding of science, namely that we have to address this issue and we have to be serious about it.
I therefore voted in favour of Mr Sterckx's report on establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system, since this system fits into a wider context aimed at improving the safety of maritime traffic and making it easier to manage, something which I have already endorsed on many occasions.
With the Treaty of Lisbon, we will be stronger in the future and we will be better able to act.
Encouraging many of these countries to make their agricultural economies dependent on the EU is an attempt to bind these countries to an agreement that imposes on them an agricultural model based on monoculture for export, resulting in obvious and serious economic, social and environmental problems for both the people of many African countries and for the people of the EU Member States.

The fact that the system works is proof that the market, competition and environmental protection are not mutually exclusive ideas.

The Commission is grateful to the European Parliament for its persistent efforts to combat discrimination.

Voting time
We think that we ought to start with a regularisation programme for these workers who have already been absorbed into the labour market: we think that the Blue Card is a mistake, in making a selection upstream of immigration; we think that the definition of highly qualified workers is too restrictive and we think that Community preference is a form of outright discrimination.

However, we are working on this and we hope that it will be implemented soon.
I admit I am often taken aback by some of the views expressed, but then that is what we are here for.

It will also make the travelling circus, as our once-monthly move is often described, a thing of the past.
The same applies to NATO partnership and what I consider to be particularly important in the case of the Western Balkans is that Serbia has a commendable minorities policy which could be exemplary for many EU Member States, as the wide-ranging cultural autonomy that is manifest in the genuine operation of the councils of various national minorities guarantees the continued existence of the minorities.

The fact that we will have a European regulator to help each Member State's enterprises to be treated on an equal basis in the other 26 Member States and that the energy suppliers on the other 26 markets will have new opportunities is an important aspect of this regulation, resulting in the creation of completely new opportunities.
Unfortunately, this is at the expense of innovation and quality.

The ability for people in Serbia to travel more easily to the European Union would also reinforce the ties between us and undoubtedly contribute to the democratisation process and to the pro-European Union sentiment in Serbian society.

Nonetheless, the existence of different definitions of 'youth' in the various Member States, as well as the fact that youth policy is covered by the principle of subsidiarity, show the problems involved in effectively implementing the instruments of youth policy.
We think it is a poor state of affairs that neither the Commission nor the Council has indicated where we are to find the money for these investments in the recovery plan - investments that not only we here in Parliament, but also the Heads of State or Government of the EU, support.
Unfortunately, poverty is and remains the main enemy for humankind and it cannot be mitigated without real cooperation between international bodies and national states, but especially between the European Union and the United States of America.

President Barroso, you said just now that Member States are achieving less than half what they set out to achieve on the 20% target for energy saving by 2020, so why is the Commission not pushing hard to make that target binding on Member States?
I am very pleased that today's plenary session has eliminated some serious shortcomings from the proposed regulation on harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products, which were inserted into this technical standard by the socialist rapporteur.
Torture is used.
That is an impressive statistic.
If we do not have the courage to demand greater commitment to Europe from national governments, then we will never achieve a meaningful, lasting solution.

We called for this mandate to be utilised in order to genuinely drive forward the reforms.
We, in Europe, and we, in the international community, have allowed the situation to get worse; we did nothing when Israel's security was under threat, and we did nothing when the blockade was making life in Gaza absolutely impossible.

The lack of distribution systems has often resulted in a lack of safe drinking water for the most disadvantaged people.

10.
Mr Reinfeldt, you have proved there are no easy answers to difficult questions.
I have today voted against the resolution on the Doha Development Agenda because I am opposed to any kind of liberalisation of public services.

Given that the following months are crucial to the European Union's budgetary policy and that, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, budgetary transfers or reviews will follow up until the start of 2010, a clear-cut procedure must be established for this transitional period to facilitate the implementation of the budget and the adoption of amending budgets.

The credibility of the European Union and peace in the region are at stake.

Finally, to conclude, this will clearly encourage people outside Europe to think of Europe as a single area, a united Europe, a common area, and it will forge European culture and identity beyond our borders.
After all, Prime Minister, it is essentially a matter of solidarity.
So it is a combination of the Council giving recommendations and the Member States needing to take their share of responsibility and adjust a little, depending on the circumstances in the countries.
Without prevention we can achieve nothing.
Measures are needed to rein in late payment in commercial transactions so as to protect the good health of the European economy, avoiding situations where production structures are financially stifled and there is overcharging on financing products, thus increasing dependence on the banking sector.

However, I would really like to emphasise that, although we have not succeeded in including the very hazardous PBT chemicals or a priority list for evaluation here and now, at least we have gained a text that says we will promote this at UN level and that it will be included in the UN system.

In the Community's view, good regulatory practice can, among other things, help to avoid unnecessary obstacles to international trade and make sure that legislation is not more trade-restrictive than necessary.

Do we really wish to aggravate the situation?
I would also like to draw your attention to a view which has been voiced many times today, namely, that the balance in the Western Balkan countries is very delicate.
(DE) Mr President, based on the Rules of Procedure, I think that is impossible.
(NL) Madam President, I voted in favour of the Lefrançois report.
The human race is not omnipotent and never will be.
We do indeed want to see more social market economy in your programme - as far as we were concerned, the previous Commission was rather too liberal in that regard.
If we still have a few differences of opinion, that is due to the fact that we have different experiences in the various Member States in terms of the functioning or non-functioning of the rail network.
I think that the future of those relations aiming at greater stability and security and increased political, economic and social cooperation, must also take into account the human rights situation in each country and the strengthening of trade relations and energy cooperation, as well as paying attention to development needs and the commitments undertaken as regards improving the living conditions of the citizens of the region.
I therefore agree with the rapporteur of this text with regard to respect for Parliament's prerogatives, and that negotiation processes should be sent in time so as to prevent unnecessary delays or serious disruption of EU relations with those countries.
It means repealing all the directives on deregulation and liberalisation of competition in the energy sector, guaranteeing the public regulation and ownership of the entire nuclear sector, including on issues relating to decommissioning and subcontracting.
Thus, we condemn the recent attacks on Christian communities in various countries and expresses solidarity with the families of the victims; we express our deep concerns about the proliferation of episodes of intolerance and repression and violent events directed against Christian communities, particularly in the countries of Africa, Asia and the Middle East.
That is the purpose of Mrs Toia's report on which you will be expressing an opinion, and, at this point, I should like to commend the quality of the work that she has done.
My long spell as a parliamentarian both in the French National Assembly and in the European Parliament (27 years) enables me to say that the attitude of the latter in lifting Mr Gollnisch's parliamentary immunity was particularly abhorrent.
Our responsibility is shared, first of all because the situation of the Roma has not changed fundamentally in the new Member States after enlargement or in the candidate countries while awaiting enlargement.
First, for fixed quantities at fixed prices, followed then by a tendering system should the situation so require.
How can they be considered safe enough for operation in crowded urban conditions?
This has been absent in recent years.
It does not even have the courage to call it by its name: Islamic terrorism.
In the interests of Roma inclusion, it is also perhaps necessary to make use of the funding options provided by the PROGRESS programme, the lifelong learning programme, the cultural programme (2007-2013) and the public health programme (2008-2013).
Was it the case that there was too little willingness on the part of the Member States to support Frontex accordingly?
I think we need to spend more time and money on the promotion of democracy and build a true European endowment for democracy.
Private consumption is benefiting from sustained job creation, so that our latest statistics show an unemployment rate in the euro area and in the EU that is almost comparable to historical lows: in the case of the euro area, unemployment is below 7%.

In this regard, extending the periods for benefiting from financial resources and simplifying the application procedures, especially for the new Member States, are extremely important.
Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution, and there are at least two important issues in the document I would like to clarify my position on.
The last thing I absolutely have to mention is that the UK, which had initially decided not to be involved in the adoption of the regulation following its reservations about the Rome Convention, has now apparently decided to take part after all, in the light of the wording produced by the negotiations.
What we are debating here is nothing other than extending the working hours of self-employed workers.
It is an important agreement for the EU and our aviation sector.
How could we have got into such a situation?
The Commission recommendation on the active inclusion of people excluded from the labour market and the EPSCO Council Conclusions of 17 December 2008 on common active inclusion principles to combat poverty more effectively both highlight the importance of access to adequate resources, alongside quality services and inclusive labour markets.
I should like to offer my congratulations on the excellent work carried out by Mr Callanan.
in writing. - (IT) The world has tolerated China's bullying of the Tibetan people and culture for decades, for reasons of geopolitical opportunism.
The crisis has dramatically reversed the favourable conditions in which the economic and financial sector operated until 2007, and the majority of Member States need to undergo a process of consolidating their accounts to reduce public debt.
I agree with this proposal, for which I voted, but I think that catch control needs to be scientifically monitored, navigation control systems need to be modernised and wrecks need to be cleaned.
All this, as you said Baroness Ashton, can happen if we are able to make proactive contributions of two kinds: firstly, a diplomatic contribution, but also - as you stated, High Representative - a substantial and material contribution.
Now I should like to ask the Commission and the Council what action they will take to make that moratorium more general and support a general ban.
One of the prerequisites for the functioning of democracy is participation.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are discussing three measures relating to the health and protection of consumers, which we have already voted in favour of in committee and which we will vote in favour of in plenary.
The European External Action Service (EEAS) is now well set to become an operational diplomatic corps.
When Commissioner Dimas had his preliminary interview with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we also raised this problem with him.
This position should not be understood as a denial of the policy of Community competence as a legal basis for the legislation, but as an upgrading of the requirements of the ordinary procedure in this sphere, to meet the higher values recognised in the Treaty.
(FI) Mr President, I voted in favour of this proposal, which is a very worthy one, as it concerns whether we should fund parties using taxpayers' money.
It is clearly a loophole if a nominal joint account enables evasion of attachment orders, but genuine third party funds must be protected.
All of this is fully in keeping with the goals set out in the Lisbon strategy launched by the European institutions at the dawn of the new millennium.
It is hardly surprising, therefore, that the citizens are losing patience with the policies of the European Union.
Sorry, but we will have the explanation of vote from Mr Helmer.
We therefore believe that, based on this consideration, we should commit to a transitional security system that will enable the gradual demilitarisation of all security in the world.
We must therefore fight this counterfeiting.
Moreover, in spite of the 2007 Commission Communication entitled Black Sea Synergy - A new regional cooperation initiative, measures were taken soon after that time with a view to implementing an effective strategy for the future of the Black Sea.
I had heard nothing about it until literally this week and suddenly I get deluged with approaches, both from the IASCF and from the Commission, trying to persuade me one way or the other as to whether the IMF should be included in the monitoring group.
The public authorities in Tunisia have the capacity to provide the people with a package of basic services, services that other countries in the region have not yet been able to implement, and I believe that it is important to point this out, too.
In this regard - as you have proposed - we must enter into negotiations with the Council Presidency as soon as possible in order to agree a number of amendments.
Better air conditioning, better roads and a change in driver behaviour - in other words, all of us.
There was agreement that we should continue with the holistic approach to the pension reforms.
We need to think about whether Europe's innovation policy even has a future, if regional policy does not support it.
Moreover, the number of complaints will doubtless continue to grow with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the incomplete or delayed implementation of European legislation by Member States.
I would like to know whether this is true, and whether the representatives of large companies will take part in negotiations on the Russian side.
Obliging EU states to allow asylum seekers to work after six months, if their claim is not decided, is very important: they would retain dignity and also pay tax.
The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on the 5th World Water Forum in Istanbul, 16-22 March 2009, by Mr Borrell Fontelles, on behalf of the Committee on Development - B6-0015/2009).
It enables a State, when asked, to provide help through its special units.
By way of example, I would like to recall the 2006 infringement proceedings on radio spectrum allocation in Italy, which my colleague Neelie Kroes and I opened.
Although we are now thinking about and debating the next multiannual framework, it was important to reiterate the fact that cohesion policy remains an essential lever for growth and that the budget earmarked for it should not be reduced.
The climate energy package has important symbolic value, as it illustrates the fact that the representatives of half a billion citizens, 500 million people, have managed to agree on some very clear-cut actions, strategies and aims in this important and sensitive agenda despite today's difficult economic circumstances.
Both are, therefore, very good reports.
The European Union should make use of its diplomatic tools - Mrs FerreroWaldner, please say this to President Barroso - we must meet with the Dalai Lama and do him the honour of allowing him to speak, in order to find the truth.
Thank you.
On the other hand, what is very clear, and what is documented in all kinds of impact studies that have already been done by the way by the Commission, on all kinds of items, is that a lot of our jobs are linked to intellectual property rights and that is one of the reasons we attach such importance to that topic.
Expanding trade is a common interest for Europe and Ukraine, but there is a need for undistorted trade that also ensures the application by Ukraine of the social, employment, animal health, plant health and environmental rules. Failing this, we will have to face many problems.
For that support to be effective, we need to strengthen our common foreign and security policy and make the EU election observation missions more efficient.
Personally, apart from support for the diversification of transport routes for the import of gas, I consider the appeal to expedite the achievement of internal market energy in the current legislature and the necessity to revisit the entire problem of gas storage as major contributions of the report.
Environmental economic accounts should contribute to policy evaluation, particularly by making data available on the environmental impact of economic activities.
One point that I think we need to stress more is education.
Transport is a very wide area.
We need a European solidarity and cohesion policy, backed up with specific legislative, fiscal and financial measures.
I would like to call on Commissioner Barnier, who promised us that the Commission would take a more energetic approach, to adopt measures to improve this situation.
This specific legislation organises the working time of persons performing mobile road activities, such as bus drivers and lorry drivers.
So this is also a democratic task and mission for all of us.
For Lithuania it spells another sequential step towards deeper European integration.
If universities are able to submit projects to meet the requirements of the lifelong learning programme during the 2007-2013 period, the European Commission is prepared to finance these projects as well.
I would suggest that farmers in Ireland will now be more supportive of the Lisbon Treaty because they fear that Member States will have more control over agriculture policy and they know the dangers of that from our budget for 2009 when the Irish Government slashed support for agriculture: they trust Europe more than their Member State.
I support the idea expressed in this report about the need to channel the resources towards those measures aimed at achieving the Europe 2020 strategy objectives.
(For the results and other details on the vote: see Minutes)
Let me make three brief points in response.
The second matter is about the Union.
I therefore think that we can cooperate as closely as possible within the framework of the new legal basis.
Energy-hungry emerging economies and wasteful industrial countries were not even prepared to implement the Kyoto Protocol.
Establishing the G20 was the brainchild of President Sarkozy, who believes that nowadays, the global economy is no longer regulated by the 8, but by all the major developing countries, too.
There has been a further decline in employment in European Union Member States and it is forecast that this will continue.
We are in agreement on that.
It is different from the President of the Commission, who was selected by the Heads of State or Government and elected by this Parliament.
The final version of the draft agenda for this sitting, as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 30 April 2009, pursuant to Rule 132 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed.
The second type of measure relates to increasing grants for student exchange.
I am calling on the Commission to require that the relevant law should be upheld in all Member States and to do all it can to ensure that it is implemented.
Madam President, before we criticise Russia for human rights abuses, we should look at similar abuses even within the European Union: countries in which opposition parties are physically attacked, such as Hungary, or attacked by the militia of the ruling party, such as even the United Kingdom, or countries that lock people up for non-violent dissent or ban political parties, like Belgium.
The situation on the ground is dreadful.
However, in all our attempts to improve the internal market, we must not forget the numerous imports from third countries.
However, I also have concerns about the current position of some EU heads of government.
Written Statements (Rule 149)
It is high time!
I voted for this report and, in particular, for its provisions that follow on from the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December 2009.
It seems legitimate that the future financial agenda - the 2020 strategy - should provide resources which will help this type of development in the Member States.
Thus we need to attract investment, but at the same time improve all EU programmes which could support this highly important sector, and try to overcome the gap between research and application which is characteristic of many productive sectors in the European Union.
Giving women that power means that when children are born, they are wanted and are genuinely able to develop - something that is every child's basic right.
We would all like to achieve the same result, but at this stage we have not yet found the compromise that suits and brings all the potential together to resolve this issue.
That said, the end result that we have is an open and reasonably balanced one.
The terrorist threat will therefore never succeed in bringing democracy to its knees!
- After the vote on recital J
I call on you to be responsible.
First of all, this resolution allows us to further improve the content of our annual reports on competition policy and secondly, and more importantly, it will serve as the basis for the Commission to engage in detailed dialogue with Parliament.
On the one hand, there is a constant attempt to hide the true situation in Europe.
(Loud applause)
I should like to thank Parliament for the support we have obtained over recent years, for the good cooperation that I have always enjoyed from you, the representatives of the citizens of the European Union.
The restructuring plan for these shipyards is forever being rejected, which is bound to result in them collapsing, instead of helping the European shipbuilding industry to regain its place in the world.
Single European Sky (debate)
This motion for a resolution of the European Parliament on implementation of the guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States rests on a number of pillars, of which I would highlight: the current economic crisis, which is increasing unemployment and social exclusion; the need to create synergies that encourage development with a view to pursuing the objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy; and the Commission's proposal that, under the terms of the Annual Growth Survey, the same employment policy guidelines should be adopted for 2011 as for 2010.
It lasted two years. Now I buy a new microwave every year - the cheapest I can find - and it is then thrown away.
Governments also give priority to good relations with their colleagues in dictatorial states, instead of bringing pressure to bear in order to improve the situation there.
The other aspects of the Commission's proposal are very technical, with many details related to the construction and use of fishing gears in the Atlantic.
We cannot agree that the Amsterdam test would involve an unjustifiable administrative burden.
May I remind you of the thought to be found in the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, that one condition for effective soil protection is the maintenance and development of agriculture. Soil nurtured by farmers retains its fertility, but when it is deprived of this care it turns into a desert.
We had differing opinions, we still have differing opinions, and that is why we should not come back to it to try and arrive at a new resolution.
I understand that a reform of the wine market is necessary.
The financial aid released through the fund will enable the Portuguese authorities, particularly the regional government of Madeira, to recover part of the expenses they incurred in responding to the emergency.
Who is next, Spain, Portugal, Italy or Ireland?
The basic objective is to eliminate the pay gap between the two sexes and the equalities caused by it and to take measures to support working single mothers by making working times more flexible.
The next item is the report by Mr Parish, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes - C6-0391/2008 -.
This approach was at least proposed, and when we received the report it was not yet clear when the Treaty would materialise.
Aspects of family law, including civil status, reproductive rights and adoption rights must not be included as part of the scope of application of the proposal for a directive, a fact which must doubtlessly be made clear from the legislative text.
Rise in food prices (vote)
It is incomprehensible that the Commission intends to switch the allocation of funds from a regional to a national basis, or even at European level, rejecting the criterion of proximity that has always underpinned cohesion policy.
The case must be diverted away from the UN Security Council and back to the International Atomic Energy Agency.
At a time when the Iberian peninsula holds two important presidencies (the Council of the European Union via the Spanish Prime Minister, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, and the European Commission via Portugal's José Manuel Barroso), I regret that the Spanish Presidency has not demonstrated its capacity to bring added political value to relations with the continent of America outside the United States and Canada.
If the EU is mentioned it may be some small aside, but nothing much more than that.
Mr Swoboda, it can be done.
I also consider it very important to support lifelong learning and activities that are not just for young people.
A renewed increase in the euro-area aggregate fiscal deficit ratio is projected for 2008.
Nevertheless, time is still spent debating whether we are a hundred per cent certain that humans are causing climate change or not.
It provides an insight into the effects of sector-based Community and decentralised activity such as research and development, the common agricultural policy, traffic and transport, the job situation and countering climate change.
Naturally, I defer to the wishes of Parliament, after having sought to explain the reasons why I have brought this possibility to the attention of Parliament.
The European Union's Generalised System of Preferences (vote)
Nevertheless, the Commission works with Member States to foster mutual learning and exchanges of good practice.
A very important point of concern for smaller enterprises is the administrative burden, most of which is brought to bear by national and decentralised governments.
I cannot agree with the World Trade talks in Geneva.
This status is necessary for convergence in relation to the budget and the organisation of the political parties at European level and their foundations.
It can only be considered an alternative to fossil fuels, however, if we can produce it from renewable energy sources at a competitive price, without emitting carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere in the process.
Any suspension would lead to passengers and airlines from the Union experiencing significant losses to the benefits that they have enjoyed since March 2008.
The second priority is the implementation of the Pact on Immigration and Asylum.
One of the recurring criticisms by Member States of the proposed recast of procedures is that it will lead to an unnecessary financial burden on them, but there is a significant body of evidence - and I pay tribute to what the Commission said on the Solihull project in the United Kingdom - that front-loading asylum procedures leads to better decisions at first instance; quality decision making is a key element which we must not miss.
We can only overcome the present financial crisis through joint efforts, which is why we need to unite and work together on this common initiative.

on behalf of the UEN Group. - Madam President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office and the Commissioner, as well as my colleagues, for their comments so far.
I would like to propose that this period be expanded in order to maximise many economic, safety and environmental benefits which are associated with the summer time period.
This is the biggest crisis that you have ever had, and I am telling you now that this is serious.
The crisis is a structural one, and has not been caused merely by current circumstances, as you have said, but by the successive deregulations.
Also, all Members who have a financial interest in the alcohol industry should declare an interest.
Furthermore, in these conclusions, Council agreed to urgently develop the strengthened medium- and long-term measures relating inter alia to transparency regarding the physical flow of gas, demand and storage volumes, regional or bilateral solidarity arrangements, to address the issue of missing energy infrastructure interconnections (which is a huge problem), to continue to diversify the transport route and sources, and to address the financing aspects of this, also by speeding up the revision of the Security of Gas Supply Directive.
Everyone knows that we pursue a policy of double standards.
It is important to understand the past and the causes of the crisis, and I think the Union has done its homework on that, but today, the focus must be on the future.
But will European society be healthier for smoking tobacco of clearly inferior quality imported from third countries?
We also strongly oppose references to the Lisbon Treaty, in particular those which suggest that the competences of the European Union in the field of climate change are not already sufficient.
Member States must finally abandon the negotiation of bilateral readmission agreements with Kosovo, which are leading to Roma being returned to lead-contaminated camps in northern Mitrovica, as Mr Hammarberg, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, has been able to demonstrate.
Firstly, a balance must be maintained between children's security and data protection.
This requires the creation of the right technical, practical and economic conditions.
Moves to strengthen and improve the existing legal provisions are to be encouraged, especially as regards the transparency of air fares.
I think that is the consensus between the finance ministers and, by the way, that was also the position that the European Union brought to the G20.
This is reflected in the lower salaries for women, the smaller number of women who work when they have dependants, as well as in the sharing of responsibility between men and women in family life.
(PL) Mr President, Mrs Ashton, I would like to ask Mrs Ashton a somewhat indiscreet question.
First and foremost, we must concentrate on dealing with fisheries infringements within the Union.
After all, transport is responsible for 30% of CO2 emissions, which is why I am pleased to see that it has been accepted that transport should be included in the central demands of the Europe 2020 strategy.
On the Roma community - I believe that the Presidency has responded on this - I should like to point out in fact that we organised the Roma Summit on 16 September.
It will also establish the obligation to pay default interest for late payment These are rules based on absolute justice, and they can help to alleviate the situation of many companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
Faced with this crisis and this price fall, it goes without saying that Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development wishes to find out from the Commission what we can do right now and in the future to escape this crisis and, above all, what measures could be adopted in the coming months to support farmers and to ensure that the agricultural markets are less volatile.
The general principles of the European Union's policy towards third countries concerning the death penalty, adopted in 1998 and reviewed in 2008, set out the criteria for issuing demarches and define the standards that should be used.
That is why the Commission hopes to encourage international cooperation in this area and will be organising a meeting this year with international organisations and EU agencies to try to coordinate the respective activities of these bodies.
But leaving that political difference aside, I - happily - am not a Conservative, therefore I do not have to vote blindly for complete nonsense.
The solutions which will be reached must ensure the State of Israel of its continued existence in the region and provide the Palestinians with the guarantee that they will be able to live with dignity in their own viable, democratic and independent state.
They are not ready now, and they never will be.
I, too, would like to make a personal comment.
My special thanks go to Mrs Creţu who drafted the opinion on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality.
I would also like to point out here that if we suppress or attempt to suppress this programme we would send out a very bad signal at this very delicate moment in time, when many Europeans do not have enough to eat.
The European Parliament has adopted the Council's position of 10 December 2010 on the draft general budget which was presented by the Commission on 26 November 2010.
I feel that the European Union and NATO must cooperate with each other, avoiding any potential rivalry.
It is a directive that introduces rigorous limits on the use of 33 substances, notably insecticides, chemical and industrial substances and heavy metals.
It must be the other way round.
It is also worth pointing out that this measure does not represent increased risks in terms of illegal immigration and public security, while the Taiwanese government's commitment to extend the exemption of visas to all 27 Member States by the end of 2010 should also be emphasised.
The European Union telecoms legislative framework arose in the 1990s, and was intended to liberalise domestic markets dominated by state monopolies.
I would also like to underline that we need a policy on flounders and flatfish, as we have already said.
The Bulgaria-Turkey-Greece area is one of the most sensitive parts of the European Union's external borders in terms of illegal migration.
We have also sought coherence there with access to jobs.
In spite of the lack of agreement with the Member States on the proposal for a directive, we have persisted, and will continue to do so.
The report seeks to provide a framework highlighting the integrating role of cohesion policy and the contribution it makes to increasing the EU's global competitiveness.
I think that we have to take action, that we cannot leave everything as it is.
I hope that this report will send a clear message about integrating gender equality as part of achieving a fair pension system.
That is another blow!
Therefore, as rapporteur, I drew up another draft report, modifying the legal basis.
I would like to underline that the first message to come from the Council was one of solidarity, compassion and readiness to provide humanitarian as well as technical assistance.
For this reason, the coming 2010 review conference between the parties to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty is of particular importance.
What will prove possible, however, depends on the Croatian Government and the cooperation between it, that is the ruling coalition, and the opposition in the Croatian Parliament.
Mr President, in the current economic climate, I think it is crucial that we do everything in our power to support those members of society who wish to contribute to our economy.
It is therefore also fitting for the motion for a resolution to highlight the case of Mumia Abu-Jamal as one of the specific cases on which to focus in the coming period, among other things, by representatives of the EU taking up the case with the US authorities, the US administration and, of course, the US President too.
In various parts the Busuttil report urges the Commission to take action.
At the same time, there has been the transfer of certain amounts towards the modernisation of a region.
Lastly, I should like to voice my support for two powerful ideas upheld by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats): the power conferred on the European Commission to adopt delegated acts should be reviewed every five years, and a verification clause should be introduced - the verification clause being the second powerful idea in this regulation.
in writing. - I voted in favour of this resolution, together with the big majority, including the two oral amendments made during the vote.
For that reason, it would also have been good if Mrs Cruz had been present.
(The order of business was thus established)
If it further promotes fishing as a viable industry for the small and medium operator, especially family-owned fishing boats, then I certainly can support it, because, as it is, fishing is dangerous and in many parts of the world exploitive - not just of fish, but also of people.
Forwarding of texts adopted during the sitting: see Minutes
In view of this, I decided to endorse his candidacy.
And this too merits greater support on our part.
In these difficult times, the European Commission ought to be ready to assist, assess, advise and to propose solutions that are not tainted by suspicions of being driven by the political or protectionist interests of individual Member States.
As the EU, we should support the Arab countries in the peaceful pursuit of reforms.
3.
We will carefully examine the recommendations of the Barnier Report when the proposals are submitted.
A potential market of hundreds of billions of euros.
That is the only way of building the confidence required for accession.
Nevertheless, I urge you: this must remain within the confines of common sense, with no consideration for the populism of certain elements of the gutter press that seems to devote itself to earning money through its populist exaggerations of serious topics in the European Union.
We do not have sufficient nurseries and crèches.
Christian nurses have been disciplined for offering to pray with patients and, only today, Lillian Ladele, a Christian registrar who was told to perform civil partnerships or face dismissal, has lost her case for religious discrimination at the Court of Appeal in the United Kingdom.
I would also like to call on the Commission to concentrate more, when performing impact assessments, on the transparency of the entire assessment process, to strive harder for its independence, and not to aim for just one solution to a problem in its proposals, but to assess multiple variant solutions to a specific situation independently.
The economic crisis has taught us that strict auditing and oversight are indispensible.
This is why we are voting today and weighing up whether what you are saying is convincing.
This is why the absence of the Council is so important - our appeals are directed to the Council, which appoints special coordinators.
As already mentioned by the Minister, the European Union established a two-tier framework to support the closure of Guantánamo, firstly through the Justice and Home Affairs Council conclusion of 4 June 2009 and the annexed information exchange mechanism and, secondly, through the Joint Statement of the European Union and its Member States and the United States of America on the Closure of the Guantánamo Bay Detention Facility and Future Counter-Terrorism Cooperation of 15 June 2009.

This is the right step in the right direction.
Basically, no country has ever achieved 100% utilisation of structural funds, and priorities shift over time.
This is why I am fighting for better labelling of food imitations in the Regulation on the labelling of foodstuffs, for example.

Many countries are currently experiencing problems.
It will give some benefits to consumers and small businesses.
I hope they are not going to vote against that fund tomorrow in plenary.
Implementing a framework agreement designed to promote cooperation in the fight against illegal immigration and aiming, at the same time, at political dialogue based on human rights, is one of the priorities for the Union's Mediterranean policy.
Is it a new earthquake, does it have a different cause? I repeat once again, taking as my starting point the last fatal earthquake and the victims you referred to and - I would add - the consequential cultural damage and destruction, that we should highlight the European dimension of this phenomenon.
The truth is that, in this case as well, the absence of restrictions that was demanded with regard to suppliers and services provided - for operations between countries, within each country, and even outside the EU and Canadian markets, as provided for by the Agreement - and to limitations on state intervention in airlines will contribute to the objective of opening the way to monopolistic concentration within the sector...
Not just the Hamas militants who triggered the military conflict, but innocent children, women and men.

This is the place.
When the groups were debating whether or not to in fact table today's resolution, the overriding opinion was initially one of scepticism; when questioned, most Members admitted to having no idea as to what Holodomor actually means and what it stands for.
There are already EU licences for small music publishers. While these efforts are ongoing, we should not legislate prematurely.
I suggest that we produce an own-initiative report on the actual administrative costs of the European Union here in the Committee on Budgetary Control.
Further proposals are expected in the coming weeks.
Thanks to the efficient work of the rapporteur, Ms Weber, it has been possible to identify a compromise on simplified reporting and documentation requirements, in the case of mergers and divisions of public limited liability companies which will maintain a very significant part of the savings potential of the original Commission proposal, which amounts to EUR 172 million per year.
There should also be a ban on consumers using this substance, because they do not generally have the necessary personal protective equipment and cannot be trained or supervised to ensure that they use the substance safely.
We have every confidence that this process can be restored in 2011 after overcoming minor difficulties.
It is a disgrace to us in the developed world.
The internal market operates well, on the whole.

Member of the Commission. - I am going to the places close to Athens.

on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, since I have been given the opportunity to speak in the debate on the situation of women in rural areas of the EU, I would like to draw attention to the fact that the situation of women in villages and suburban areas in the new Member States in particular is difficult and sometimes dramatic, partly because of the introduction of EU policies that impose various kinds of limits and restrictions, causing poverty and social exclusion through job losses and unprofitable production.
in writing. - I voted in favour of the resolution on the EU-Russia Summit but I see no real progress from the Russian side to combat corruption, to apply the rule of law and international law.
Anyone who wants to combat poverty - as Mr Fatuzzo has already said - must really focus more intensely on the older generation.
(DE) Madam President, some of you are probably wondering, rightly, what a Member from a landlocked European country such as Austria is doing in a debate on deep-sea shipping.

After all, we recently read in New Europe, the news source for Europe, that roaming has allegedly cost European consumers 30 billion euro.
We would soon run the risk of having a crisis much bigger than that of August on our hands, and in a country like Ukraine at the heart of Europe.
This really is a new quality.
Aware of the need to adhere strictly to the criteria set out in Copenhagen, and to meet the commitments resulting therefrom, the European Union should not, through blind obstinacy, refuse to embrace those who show themselves ready to do the same.
Many amendments are very similar for gas and I will not go into all the points which were raised when we discussed electricity.
France, for example, does not recognise any ethnic minorities and in Slovenia, the AVNOJ decisions still infringe international law.
Textile producers, especially the very smallest, now seem to have been abandoned by Europe, where big manufacturers - which have relocated - rule all.
I hope this date may prove lucky for the people of China.

The rapporteur's proposal not to establish a new European monitoring centre for migratory flows is particularly worthy of support.

We are also dealing with a global leadership crisis.
The fact is that rich countries, for example Norway and Switzerland, simply do not want to join the EU.
We fully endorse the statements and positions taken so far by the Presidency, Council and Commission, but we are also asking the Council to ensure that EU Member States and their ambassadors in Tehran are fully complying with EU guidelines on human rights defenders and on the prevention of torture.

(BG) Mr President, I will agree, to a certain extent, with what Commissioner Füle said, namely, that we can actually see tangible progress in Macedonia's development as it advances towards the European Union.
Secondly, we must create an agency for innovation and accelerate the funding of research and development in order to advance very quickly and close the technological gap between clean vehicles and safe vehicles.
The two things are not mutually exclusive, but complementary: positive contacts with China, but clear defence of religious freedom and human rights.
We want to know, now, what obligations the European Commission's negotiators are accepting on behalf of 500 million European Union citizens.
This new concept is, I believe, relevant to consideration of the outermost regions in order to guarantee them sustainable and balanced growth.
However, we demanded in our explanatory statement that the Commission explains some details more in depth.
in writing. - (FR) I voted for the Chatzimarkakis report, which seeks to improve the CAP's budgetary execution and transparency, in other words to identify the beneficiaries of aid for agriculture.
I believe that, as well as the Commission, Parliament played an important part in this improvement, in particular, the Committee on Budgetary Control, which sets great store by the subject of transparency and the effective and efficient use of public funds.
All of these are huge tasks for the diplomatic service and ones for which the High Representative needs our full support.
The EU can be influential in contributing to the start of an unprejudiced and constructive dialogue that would respect both sides.
We could start with administrative expenditure, for example, and in this respect we are still a long way from meeting the Commissioner's request to keep the increase below 1%.
We must think about the transparency of risks, the supervisory powers of regulators and the salaries at this type of institution.
In its 'Pierre de Coubertin' action plan, the White Paper therefore seeks to promote volunteering in sport and non-profit sport organisations through specific actions, including a study on volunteering and exchange of good practices within the informal EU 'non-profit sport organisation' working group.

The next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
Recently, President Lukashenko visited Moscow and signed very important agreements with President Medvedev.
I agree with Mr Saryusz-Wolski on this point: we have indeed called for this together, and received far too little support from the Council - or rather the Member States.
Nowadays confidence is the keyword, one that is reflected in the documents of the European Union as well.
(Applause)
As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I sought to uphold this idea by drawing attention to some of the main challenges we are facing in the following areas, to cite but a few examples: the scarcity and efficient use of resources, waste recovery and treatment, food quality and security, demographic change, new epidemics, and conservation of nature and biodiversity.
According to a survey published by the Region of Sicily at the end of 2009, 75% of citizens believe that European funds have no positive impact whatsoever, or very little.

Agenda: see Minutes
In spite of the fact that gender equality is a fundamental right, gender inequality on the labour market, in terms of salaries, employment rates and quality of employment, remains a serious structural problem.
Your report, of course, also expresses some concerns on the abandoning of the constitutional approach and on the extension of opt-in arrangements for particular Member States.
In view of this, EU officials and temporary agents from the diplomatic services of the Member States should have the same rights and obligations and be treated equally, particularly as regards the eligibility to assume all positions under equivalent conditions.
Under the pretext of facilitating business opportunities within international air transport, this promotes the interests of multinationals within the sector at the expense of national companies and their respective strategic interests, including those that, as is the case in Portugal with TAP, are publicly owned.

The Commission's approach to the question of the Polish shipyards, however, runs counter to these declarations.
The reforms undertaken by Serbia will enable the country to make significant progress along the path to future EU membership.
We cannot suddenly make up new competences or enter into areas where we know that it is actually sometimes the Member States that have the competences, or we are at least limited in what we can propose, or we have to work together with the other institutions.
Rather, I believe that this situation is entirely to be expected, given the number of states which make up the Union and their particular histories and interests.
38 000 performers asked for our support to redress this discrimination.
We have to stop thinking of Frontex as a temporary or isolated measure.
It may not be the job of this regulation, but it is the job of us Members to remind the Council of this and exert pressure to ensure that the text on origin marking that has been on the table since 2005 is at last put to good use.
It currently does this for employed drivers, so clearly it can also do so for self-employed drivers.
I would first like to thank the rapporteurs for the amount of work they have put in to preparing the reports on the Single Market, and also to congratulate them on the end result.
The new Director of the College may have presented an action plan, but it is not sufficient, nor is it as detailed as it should be.
FRONTEX has to take its place in this global approach, which links development and concerted management of migratory flows.
This resolution is welcome because I hope that, through this measure, an ever-growing number of Belarusian citizens will have easier access to visas for European Union states so that they can learn from us about our values and tradition.
Workers have been urged to take out non-statutory pensions, which were supposedly safer and more efficient than state pensions; their money is now in these pension funds, but they no longer have any certainty.

We must not confuse bureaucracy with transparency, because not every entry registered on a piece of paper or every approval recorded in a file contributes to making cohesion projects transparent.
Such is the case with our former fellow Member, Mr de Gucht. Such is the case with the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Mr Juncker.
Then we would have a deletion, but it would continue as follows: 'calls in particular on the Russian authorities to adopt preventive protective measures as regards human rights defenders, such as starting an investigation as soon as threats faced by them are known by the prosecutor and the judicial system;'.
The Consumer Rights Directive will enable full harmonisation of the rights of European consumers.
Consequently, I would like to ask the Commission whether it would not be a good idea nonetheless to implement veterinary border controls at which the owner of a pet animal must demonstrate that the animal travelling with him or her is free of dangerous diseases, has been vaccinated and has its papers in order in respect of the destination country.
On the other hand, I think it is also very important that we managed to keep the food security item on the political agenda and the result of the several summits we have been witnessing in 2009 has certainly been that it is now high on the international agenda and that, whenever world leaders meet, for example, latterly in Pittsburgh for the G20, there is talk of development cooperation and development policy.
Unfortunately, no mention is made of these in the report, just as no mention is made of the unacceptable conditions under which thousands of people travelling with no travel papers are held on islands and in towns of the Mediterranean, affecting the human dignity of us all.

The draft abandons regional and local level control in multi-level governance, overturning the shared management principle.
We can also introduce a lot that is good here.

We have seen some examples of that.
It is no coincidence that Moldova is the poor relation in the European family.
(DE) Madam President, I would not have asked for the floor again had not the Commissioner tried to play the victim in his closing remarks. Commissioner, you must come to terms with the fact that you are in a European forum in which you have a specific obligation to be very careful about what you say, and what you said in the Il Messaggero interview was factually incorrect.
The fact that consular staff are not aware of the visa categories 'D' and 'C' seems rather strange.
(ES) Municipal elections were held in Nicaragua on 9 November this year.
It is important to distinguish between a real crisis and a business matter in relation to gas and at what point senior political figures should enter the negotiations and what the market should control.
I refer once again to the debates we have often had in this House in recent years on the importance of reliable budget data, or reliable data for other national public accounts, GDP etc., or the need to have a price index upon which the public can fully rely.
In assessing them, we are interested in consideration being given to the specific nature of the nuclear technology used in Romania, compared with the nuclear technologies used in the EU.
Baroness Ashton, instead of just a few leaders acting together or in isolation - in Portuguese we say 'it is hard to be the priest in one's own parish' - what is needed is for Europe as a whole to take a leading role in aiding these reforms and to find a new paradigm for the Middle East that avoids radicalism and respects human rights, and women's rights in particular.
We must certainly take into account the competences of Member States in that regard.
Because - in the words of Oxfam - 'The European Parliament is today setting a world standard by pressing for a European Robin Hood tax'.
Mr Virrankoski, with regard to the preliminary draft budget, you say that it is already extremely tight and that what we are actually doing is tightening it even more.

This is the policy we have to push forward.
The Treaty of Lisbon lays the foundations for creating the European Research Area, strengthening European action in an area that is vital for economic growth and employment.
(NL) Madam President, Parliament's draft budget for 2011 is EUR 1.7 billion.
The global financial crisis has had a significant impact on both revenues and expenditure in all our countries, even if the extent and nature of that impact is not the same in all cases and the capacity of individual Member States to handle the consequences is also very different.
This TV station broadcasts 24/7 in Chinese and English via satellites over Asia, Europe, Australia and North America.
(SV) Madam President, wishful thinking is not enough to bring about a changeover to sustainable, renewable energy sources and to a climate-friendly society.
However, I firmly believe that, with regard to certain issues, it may be taking things a step too far.
Microcredits are unquestionably a major aid in combating poverty and an instrument for achieving the millennium goals.
Copenhagen stood for much more than a climate summit.
It is therefore good that we are talking about it as the reason for that - namely increasing demand - will not be going away and so prices will also continue to rise.
Your announcement today that you plan to introduce EU requirements for mandatory women quotas in corporate boardrooms is already quite promising.

The European Parliament has been saying since March that this will be our list of priorities for 2011 and that we would like those budget lines which favour youth, education and mobility to be appropriately funded, so that resources will also be found for innovative undertakings in the field of mobility, youth and education.
More specifically, bearing in mind the limited resources and means available to us, as well as the very short time period that remains, we must ensure that all these international forums and action plans are used strategically in order to support and complement the UN plan of action without undermining it in any way whatsoever.
Whilst I share your aims and always want to do things as quickly as we can - and Mr Kirkhope's aims of price transparency and consumer protection - I think that, in our speed to get this through, we have drifted away, certainly from the position that the Committee on Transport adopted at the end of May, and that the position that Council has come up with, the so-called compromise position, is different from the position that we went for in the Committee on Transport.
This problem is also dealt with in the Regulation establishing the general provisions for the structural funds and the cohesion fund and in the guidelines for regional support in the 2007-2013 period aimed at ensuring that these investments make a real and sustainable contribution to regional development.

Both EUROPOL and the European Union will lack democratic legitimacy until you put the Lisbon Treaty to a referendum.
I listened in detail to your speech, took notes and will read it again.
My fellow rapporteurs, Mrs del Castillo Vera and Mr Harbour, and I have worked together closely to achieve a coherent and efficient proposal for the end-users of these directives, namely the Commission and regulators, but one that is also positive and valuable to those looking for legal certainty, encouragement for investment, and a dynamic and balanced market, that is, operators and their employees, as well as for the primary beneficiaries of the numerous services and quality at a fair and accessible price: the consumers.
The general condemnation of Parliament regarding the suppression of information by the Commission relating to the ongoing negotiations on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) and the limitations which, by proceeding in this manner, the Commission has attempted to impose on scrutiny and democratic control, have been quite clear.

We must respond to the economic slowdown.

I should like all the same to emphasise that we have had a solid legislative base since 1975 and especially since 2006, and that the latter enabled me, in the years 1975 to 1980, to encourage women in my country who were being discriminated against to start legal proceedings against their employers, in particular from the public sector.
Essentially, these are the reasons why two Member States opted for protocols protecting against the unexpected consequences of the effects of the Charter.

The non-participation of the aviation sector in this system could cause important compensatory costs on long-term.
This begins during the school years, during PE classes, and extends right through to high-performance training in top-class sport, for here far too little consideration is given to female traits and female biological requirements. More attention needs to be directed to this.

As a result of Copenhagen, we can come to the following four conclusions.

the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) should support the reintegration of individual redundant workers into employment, and I would reiterate that assistance from the EGF is not a substitute for measures that are the responsibility of companies by virtue of national law or collective agreements, nor is it intended to finance the restructuring of companies or sectors;
Patients must be absolutely certain that the medicines they are taking are actually the medicines they expect to take.

(An intervention from the floor)
What Mr Verhofstadt cannot deny, however, is that recent years have seen a decline in the car industry in Europe and also in Flanders, and Mr Noels, the economist to whom I referred, has said that high labour costs were one of the reasons for the Americans closing Opel Antwerp instead of one of the others.
Unfortunately, the proposal was weakened by Tory and Liberal MEPs to allow for a higher emissions limit and a longer phase-in period.

One example of this is pre-accession aid, which, as we all know, is awarded to potential candidate countries, but which it only makes sense to pay if the states in question are getting to grips with their corruption problems or if the necessary structures are actually established.
I would also have preferred to see stronger sales promotion measures instead of a greater amount of intervention, such as butter fat being used once again in the ice cream industry.

I would like to take advantage of this speech to express my regret, once again, that the new President of the European Council, who was elected in mid-November and took office on 1 December 2009, has still not been to greet the Members of the European Parliament or even sent them a simple message.
Cohesion policy is the greatest instrument of solidarity in the Union, and its role in tackling the negative effects of a global crisis of this scale is, of course, essential.

One thing that we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Group are very concerned about is what portfolio the new climate commissioner will be given, since that will be crucial in deciding whether it is all just a load of hot air or whether we will have a commissioner who can really make a difference when it comes to climate change - while at the same time safeguarding Europe's competitiveness.
The Musotto report reiterates the desire to group together anti-fraud legislation.
In addition, due to the quirks of Hungarian regulations and in contravention of the right of 'habeas corpus', the judge who keeps extending the pre-trial detention does not take a close look at the incriminating evidence against them.
The second area where we need action is the on-going work of law enforcement agencies such as the police, trading standards officers and customs authorities.
However, neither the Commission proposal nor the report adopted today addresses the urgent need to develop a fuel capable of making a real difference in the fight against CO2 emissions.

I also welcome the work done by my colleague, Richard Howitt, at committee stage to produce a report that promotes the positive work that corporate social responsibility can do at European level.
The decision of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2010 calls for the sum of EUR 1 110 000 to be mobilised to finance control and monitoring activities, but primarily to finance information activities and technical and administrative assistance in connection with the use of the resources by Member States and social partners.

The crisis has taught us a tough lesson and it still has much to teach us about the static and dynamic aspects of economic policies.
As usual, our discussions amount to nothing, and then we hear Commissioner Michel almost eulogising Mr Nkunda.
However, as you may have felt from this debate, it is quite clear that this would be a very sensitive, elaborate, political and legal task because there are a lot of issues that are both legally and politically very sensitive.
I have to say that Deputy President Martinez of the European Parliament, who was an official member of the delegation representing the European Parliament, also failed to meet with the opposition, although he did meet with the families of Cuban spies arrested in the US.

The adoption of the budget each year is one of the most important duties we MEPs have.
It is in the interest of third-country nationals living in neighbouring countries to the EU - including the members of the Hungarian minority - to be able to reside legally within the area of the European Union without any bureaucratic or administrative burdens.

If this closure becomes a reality, it will have an enormous impact not just on the region, but on the country as well.
- (DE) Are there any market research findings and opinion polls that would show what information European citizens actually need regarding this Reform Treaty?
Since the Regulation entered into force, complaints have been pouring in about the application of this Regulation - 'unclear' and 'unreasonable' are words often heard.

Domestic violence and forced marriages continue to be common.
in writing. - (FR) I voted against Mrs Vălean's report because it calls for liberalisation of the energy sector and a liberal European energy policy, and we all know what tragic consequences that would have for workers in the sector and for more and more of our citizens, who might even experience regular power cuts.
We must therefore emphasise that the improvements to the system will, apart from anything else, be beneficial for patients in the long term, since better use will be made of drugs and better use will also be made of the resources employed by the relevant authorities for protecting public health.

The aim of rejecting the proposals is not to stand in the way of Europol assuming its new role as a European body, but to have the powers of this Parliament, the European Parliament, extended, especially on important matters relating to freedom, security and justice.
Some come up with all kinds of wonderful and wondrous excuses about why it cannot be done, but I can assure them that it is not astrophysics that we are dealing with.

At the onset of winter, Europe is being threatened by a gas crisis similar to that at the start of this year when dependency on Russian gas was more apparent than ever.
Until now, the international community has been incapable of changing anything there.
I therefore eagerly await the Commission's legislative proposal on 20 May, Commissioner, and I hope that we rediscover a great deal therein that the Goepel report now delivers, so that we do not have a repeat of this long discussion...

Furthermore, this agreement seriously harms a sector that provides countless jobs not only in our ACP partner countries but also in the outermost regions (ORs).
1.

(NL) Mr President, I had the honour of drawing up an opinion on Frontex on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, but that opinion was rejected by a narrow majority because the Left refused to accept that the problems involving Libya and Turkey were explicitly mentioned in the text.
I commend this report.
If common sense prevails, this Parliament will vote for a reduction of the EU budget for 2012.

Some of them have not even been charged and duly tried.

The Goulard report is part of the legislative package for reforming economic governance, which consists of six reports resulting from months of negotiations.
This Presidency, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is a Presidency of a pro-European country, a country that clearly understands that it is defending its own interests through the European project, in a country committed to European ideals, in a country led by European politicians who clearly understand that what Europe needs is to develop the European project and that this European project is probably the most generous, most critical and most important project of modern times, that this European project is important for Europeans, for the European economy, and also important for the world.
The visitors have also had an opportunity to experience, at first hand, the workings of our Parliament.
The effects of a nuclear disaster often cross national boundaries.

In addition, in order to combat unemployment among low-skilled people, as well as to promote the employment of senior citizens, it is imperative to encourage the recognition of national qualifications between the Member States, and to encourage certification by validating skills acquired through informal apprenticeship.
What this really means is that more of the decisions on the shape, content and future of Europe should be taken by citizens, and not just by representatives of the government that happens to be in power.
Predictions suggest that there will be a shortage of workers.
Even in a period of low inflation, resulting from the crisis and the trend in raw material prices, there are still microeconomic problems with price formation.

This is serious.
How would this mindset be defined?
Just who do you think you are to overthrow these democratic measures laid down for us but open for all to follow?

To this end, and without questioning the role played by the World Trade Organisation (WTO), it is crucial to liberalise trade by concluding all negotiations under way within the framework of the Doha Development Agenda (DDA), of which EU-Canada trade relations are part.
Events such as these have always led to technical improvements and safety measures.
I am referring in this case to the public key infrastructure.
As a resolution, this one is, literally, very resolute.

I can tell the Prime Minister this: if the European elite do not allow the people to speak, then, in the end, they will find other ways to make their voices heard.

This proposal will offer the possibility of adapting the rules for the publication of financial information at national and regional level.
Like many of the Member States (if not all of them), the European Union finds itself confronted with a budget which is much less grand than its ambitions and in no way sufficient for all that it would like to do.

President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have paid close attention to all the speeches made here today on the imminent summit between the European Union and Russia and in general on relations between the EU and Russia and also on Russia's internal situation as you see it. I must say that, as of course is my duty, I have duly noted and will take due account of these opinions.
I would like to inform the House that, as rapporteur, I support the amendment tabled by the socialists but cannot accept the PPE and the GUE/NGL amendments.

A cleverly designed financial transaction tax would provide such a revenue, while simultaneously curbing speculation on financial markets.
However, I am somewhat disappointed that although appointments to the EEAS will be made using a thorough selection procedure based on merit and having regard to gender and geographical balance, it still does not guarantee proportional representation of nationals of all Member States.
Solidarity is one of the European Union's fundamental values, and an economic recession is a good time to show it.
rapporteur. - (SL) Madam President, I am very pleased that this debate, too, has shown that there are many points on which we have similar, almost identical, positions and that these are the points which are key to ensuring safe management of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste.
We need to do things better.
This is totally natural.
What an outrageous and baseless comparison!
I am grateful to you, Mr President-in-Office, for having already set the ball in motion.
We did not join the euro, thank God.
A similar process is now at work with Europol, which has gradually extended its remit to cover a whole series of crimes that are national in nature - but with the rather fascinating oversight that its personnel still have diplomatic immunity; in other words, they cannot be held to account for abuse of police powers.
Those are extremely appealing prospects, particularly in economically strained times.
On the other hand, the Czech Republic, as well as many other countries, will have to introduce liability under criminal law for legal persons, which for post-socialist countries is an unknown historical concept.

Mr President, I will abide by your rule.
We can see that there are problems in this area.
This resolution has the support of all the political groups and it is important because, quite simply, it highlights the challenges of an ageing population - these challenges that mean that, today, in Europe, we have more than seven million people suffering from Alzheimer's disease, a figure that it is estimated will double over the next 20 years.
So let us try to act collectively.
That is something positive, and the discussion in depth is there and should continue.

The European Council must make the necessary preparations, but should not jump to any hasty conclusions.

We agree that the books need to go online and fast.
Perhaps I might make a comment to my honourable friends from the former colonial power who are preparing to leave our group.

The second is a measure where the consumer can fix, together with his operator, a ceiling over which he does not want to pay any more so that communications are then cut; and the third is because we have seen that the whole problem here comes from highly overpriced wholesale costs which one operator imposes on another.
We, the nations of Europe, simply cannot condone this enormous injustice by failing to act.
As you know, I hope the governments will very soon agree on that and so I hope that there will be a political decision in the European Council confirming the decisions regarding the European Stability Mechanism and, of course, you know what our position is.
This phenomenon is reflected not only in violence in the family against women and girls, but also through exploitation, acts of sexual violence, human trafficking, honour crimes, dangerous traditional practices, such as the burning of brides or early marriages, and other forms of violence against women's bodies, minds and dignity.

In particular, in the light of food shortages, we must emphasise the importance of a strong CAP which will take on a key role in future in overcoming global challenges.
Let me end with one final remark: we really must see the difference here between what happens in practice in the Council and what happens in our own institution.
This is therefore a crucial issue and, at the same time, one which is sensitive to errors.
I agree with the introduction of a tax on financial transactions which could help to tackle the highly damaging trading patterns in financial markets, improve the efficiency of the market itself, reduce price volatility and create incentives for the financial sector to make long-term investments with added value for the real economy.

It is also important, and in this respect I fully support the rapporteur, to examine and establish the limits of consent requested of users, whether by governments or private companies, in terms of giving up part of their privacy in return for certain Internet services or privileges.

Modern industrial policy is so much more than that.
Similar to certain Member States of the EU, Russia can determine its administrative obligations relating to visas independently, and these need to be based on reciprocity.

Council and Commission, where is your strategy of energy diversification now?
What I do not want, under any circumstances, is a situation in which creditors or third parties suffer harm precisely because we have a European regulation.

(ES) Madam President, thank you very much to the Commissioner for being here.
At the same time, he said that 90% of these agreements are not worth a pin.

It is well-known that education and training are essential priorities for the European Union, in order to achieve the Lisbon objectives.
