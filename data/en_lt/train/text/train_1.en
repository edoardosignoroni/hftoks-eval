Before closing I would like to stress that today's debate will provide an important contribution to the preparation of the CFP reform, but it will also send an important political signal - a positive signal - to the men and women of the European fisheries sector, who are prepared for tougher discipline but are also expecting a message of hope for their future.
It is also true that there is no record of it having received support from any European funds for this operation.
The principle of good governance does not prevail in the document either.
With that sole exception, no country will see a reduction compared to what is planned already in the Treaty for 2009.
Therefore, it is incomprehensible that some governments of Member States, such as the Netherlands - my own country - are now tampering with the development budget and also seeking to tamper with these objectives.

I believe that it has stalled and it should be restarted so that we can see some progress.

In some countries, like my country, Romania, this amounts to 50% of all deaths.
However, the preparatory phase of the legislation made it clear that the biocides sector is not very harmonised and neither the Commission nor the Member States have sufficient experience or knowledge to propose specific measures on biocides, therefore the decision was not to include this category of products in the initial proposal that has been presented for your consideration.
According to surveys, the Slovaks living in Hungary feel at home in their newly chosen surroundings and the local authorities are now thinking about providing Slovak-language nurseries and schools, even though they are not Hungarian citizens, because bilingualism is an important value in Hungary.
Sadly, we do not have a spare planet.
Judicial reservation means that we do not leave it up to enterprises alone to decide which sanctions are imposed; instead, using rights, as captured in the European Convention on Human Rights, we have ensured that consumers can defend themselves and service providers do not have excessive power.

The technical regulations governing the use and neutralisation of cyanide have helped minimise the risks to the environment and workers' health.

The Committee on Transport and Tourism has therefore decided to table this own-initiative report with the aim of setting out some general principles regarding how air agreements should be evaluated in terms of substance, and of the procedures the committee might adopt in order to remain well informed throughout the course of negotiations and so that it has an opportunity to express its priorities well before being confronted with the final decision and merely being able to adopt or reject it.
Therefore, I also agree that transnational sites should be held in particular consideration, in virtue of their symbolic importance.
When determining the final quota reductions, therefore, I am in favour of taking into account the scale of production in each Member State.

The challenges we face must not be underestimated.
I am pleased to see that many amendments fully support the objectives of the Commission's proposals on the directive on waste electronic and electrical equipment, namely: to fully reap the environmental benefits of the WEEE Directive by setting ambitious collection and recovery targets that are realistic for all the Member States; to strengthen implementation and enforcement by establishing detailed rules to fight illegal exports of EU waste; and to reduce unnecessary administrative burdens significantly for European producers through reinforced cooperation among national authorities.

What I am interested in today is what you intend to do.

I support the position that current economic austerity and the provisions of the Lisbon Treaty may help Member States towards smarter spending on defence by pooling and sharing a larger proportion of their defence capabilities, budget and requirements, while achieving more security for their citizens, although the reality is that the economic and financial crisis affects EU national defence budgets, programmes and force structures and, therefore, more than one year after the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, there are not yet clear signs of a post-Lisbon EU holistic approach enabling traditional procedural and institutional barriers to be overcome.
In the field of regional development, there is an increase of about 3.2%, which is considered essential.

Perhaps I might expand on this by saying that our citizens also have a right to know how the European Union spends its taxes and where resources are wasted.

My vote was motivated by the fact that this report, which is aimed at organising the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities, would have actually had the effect of excluding selfemployed drivers from the scope of European legislation on the organisation of working time.
That is why, in my opinion, we should not define area aid uniformly, by which I mean at European Union level.
The Commission must identify the existing financial instruments and fiscal measures and table new proposals by 30 June 2011.
I should like to point out, as the report itself clearly indicates, that, insofar as the problem in question concerns business-to-business relationships, a large part of the Community legislation on consumer protection, including Directive 2005/29 concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices and Regulation (EC) 2006/2004 on cooperation in the field of consumer protection, does not apply.
The answer is 'no'.
The forecasting group for the ovine and caprine sectors is made up of market experts and meets twice a year to discuss market trends and forecasts.
A debate on the Eastern Partnership is also necessary due to the fact that it is not entirely clear that we all accord the same importance to this project.
Mr President, I am persuaded that the fact Kosovo was already a UN protectorate, that the solution is supported by the UN Secretary-General, and that negotiations had failed, all mean that Kosovo is a unique case in our world.

It is in the conclusions.

The number of cases identified amounted to 7.5 million in 2009, which is many more than in previous years.
I will continue to do so in the future if I can, to keep pressing home the need for Iraq's neighbours to take up their responsibilities.
This can best be done through a legislative initiative by the Commission.
I believe that our group and Parliament will support the European Commission's intentions.
Products for children demand particularly careful regulation.
The constructive dialogue involved a long monitoring process over several months between Parliament, the agencies, the Commission, the Internal Audit Service and the Court of Auditors.
I also think that farmers need to be brought into the information process because system changes are being required of them and they are not being properly briefed or led on this issue.
If Belarus can make this serious progress, then I think it is also essential that we reciprocate with a significant package of measures.
Lastly, I support the plans for 'instruments which are tailored to the needs of their users' and a reduction in red tape for small and medium-sized enterprises, which should foster decisive technological innovation.
Although the ways of providing social services, sharing competences and the conception of financial sustainability are different in EU Member States, there was a good deal of consensus among the speakers at the conference on the role and goals of social services.
Madam President, this new regulation properly implements the global Rotterdam Convention, which was adopted in 1998 but has only officially been in force since 2004.

Especially in this area many issues are interlinked.
The strengthening of the SME sector and domestic private sector will be encouraged with the aim of raising the living standard in the countries included in this programme.
An operation to provide aid and to help in reconstruction has been going on for a year.
That is enough about the French question, because a decision has been taken by the Commission on that matter, but it is not finished and is still an open procedure.
It goes without saying that SMEs, with their capacity for innovation, must be involved as equal partners.
The fact is that the list of recommendations contains a number of things I cannot support, particularly with regard to immigration policy, integration and diversity, and also the lack of essential protection of family policy.
In this regard, we in Germany must also consider internally how we could manage this better.
Libya has not ratified the Geneva Convention of 28 July 1951 or the Protocol of 1967 relating to the Status of Refugees, and at the moment, does not intend to do so.
Not only do we need rapid and confidence-building macro-solutions, but we need to prevent a similar financial crisis from occurring again.
It is here that, as the European Parliament, we have doubts.
Muchas gracias, President Arias!
May I thank all the rapporteurs for the work they have put in.
There are plenty of examples around the world where fisheries policy aids conservation and keeps fishermen in jobs and doing what they want to do.

President Sarkozy, I was under the impression that you were speaking here in your capacity as President of the European Council, and I responded in my capacity as chairman of a group in the European Parliament.
All consumers have the right to be informed, but they are also entitled to respect, which means that they must be allowed to make their own decisions.

Commissioner, are you sure that new alternative technologies and new kinds of separation and flotation separation have been properly considered?
The reason that my group and I are nevertheless opposed to the EU's accession to the European Convention on Human Rights is the fact that the disadvantages clearly outweigh the advantages.

It is about the question of mixed or unmixed waste management and how it is dealt with in accordance with the principle of self-sufficiency.
I fully understand that, and so does the House.
It seems amazing to me that anyone would wish to deny people their basic rights at EU level just because of their age, disability, religion or belief or sexual orientation.
I believe that a coherent response should increase the sector's capacity for structural adjustment and, at the same time, help its most vulnerable members, particularly small and medium-sized producers.
I hope that the European Council's conclusions will be an accurate reflection of the debates that have taken place to date on the 2050 objectives, and that they will not be published before the debate on these objectives, which is due to take place in March 2011.
This is not acceptable.
We need the legislative means to tackle similar situations, and I also firmly believe that if anyone commits a similar transgression he should bear responsibility for his behaviour.
It is even prouder to see the value of his work during his first mandate, from 2004 to 2009.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank the Portuguese Presidency for its honest and openly pro-European effort over these six months, and I also think that probably not all but some of the deficiencies that were also pointed out by Mr Watson are more the responsibility of the team than of the Presidency in that, since you cannot get blood out of a stone with the Council we have, it is rather difficult to achieve much more important results.
Parliament is very well aware of that.
Given its nature and hazards, its obvious and close links with pressing public health and environmental issues, the question of waste is paradigmatic in that its management has to be ensured by efficient, high-quality public services, since it is not acceptable to leave it to market dynamics.
It was this part of the solidarity that stood out the most.
I see no reason why this preamble should not be removed from the Border Treaty as the Tartu Peace Treaty is still a valid international treaty and the new Border Treaty only acknowledges the control line between Estonia and Russia, their border, and the external border of the European Union.

on behalf of the ITS Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Liberadzki's excellent report and his well-argued proposal for a directive on the inland transport of dangerous goods requires little discussion.
This would give rise to a highly dangerous situation.

It is mainly the universities which will benefit from this money and carry out the research.
Of course, it is much better than the situation in Libya, since Mr Gaddafi has been in power for 42 years!

The burden of proof appears to have been transferred from the authorities implementing the security measure to the people subject to it.
As this point is not made sufficiently clear in the present report, the report must be rejected.
AIDS and HIV were once the stuff of real-life horror stories in the press.
So this is the advice that the European Council must act on: taxation of financial transactions, solidarity of the banks with regard to Member States' budgets and a real recovery plan, as it was initiated a year ago, even though we criticised it at the time for not going far enough.
The real driving force behind the EU's foreign policy will be the Commission; Member States and the Council will be continually marginalised.

I welcome an integrated approach, which includes drawing up macro-regional strategies applicable to the entire European Union, in order to make regional policy more effective.
We need the reform and we are working for it.
I appreciate very much the stance she is taking in our joint struggle against software patenting at a time when the European Union has no European patent.
I support this report by my group colleague because it underlines the cross-cutting nature and the importance of culture in all aspects of life, and argues that culture needs to be taken into consideration in all EU external policies.
If we, as Europeans, are to play an active role in this respect, it is essential that we continue to do so.
The problems in this organisation have been going on for several years and are due to various reasons: the change to the accounting system, unclarified matters relating to the host state, omissions regarding the notification of contracts and the use of public funds for purposes other than those intended.
What could it learn about human rights?
author. - (RO) Mr President, I want to assure Mrs Vergiat that, as anyone can see, we are debating not only the death penalty, but also the events taking place recently on the streets of Yemen.

No European ally was willing to offer them.
It is, however, true that job creation is falling behind.
As a result, the vote on the Mathieu report on the procedure for a single permit for third-country nationals to reside and work in the territory of a Member State has been removed from the agenda for this part-session.
Haiti needs help and the basic essentials a lot more quickly than was the case last year.
Perhaps we should organise our economic policy in such a way that our citizens' savings could be safely invested in Europe, then we would not have to worry about third-country wealth funds.
Some would look on the basis of reference.

Finally, I am concerned that there is another level of conflict of interests.
Before tackling the grand question of 'alcohol and the workplace' we ought to be stressing the capital importance of role models in the formation of young people's values and attitudes.

I agree with Mrs Fraga on this matter.
We will have 12 levers: 12 specific but not exclusive proposals.
It is in that spirit that we give these three proposals, particularly the one concerning Heijmans, our wholehearted support.
Unfortunately, Yemen's domestic situation does not help, and we should bear in mind the fact that it is one of the poorest countries in the world, with serious water shortages, high unemployment and an economy heavily dependent on revenue from oil and gas, which it is estimated will be exhausted within the next 10 years.
On the one hand, it has been pointed out that such subsidies distort competition in the international market while, on the other, it has been stressed that it is essential to fight rising unemployment and that State aid certainly serves this end.
This is the stark issue facing us today in Burma, in China, in the Caucasus, and in very many regions of the world.
Ladies and gentlemen, we want a credible defence for Europe, not so that we can go to war, naturally, but so that we can ensure peace and more importantly help the world's poorest.
Mr President, at this time, one has to ask: why all this focus on tax issues, tax cooperation and tax governance?
The Portuguese Presidency is waiting for the political commitment demonstrated by Mercosur to take the form of an improved offer, so that the Commission might resume the negotiations with a view to the speedy conclusion of an agreement which is fair and balanced for both parties.
The investigation identified a number of causes.
(HU) Ladies and gentlemen, at the previous plenary session the Leader of our Group, Graham Watson, addressed this Parliament in a one-minute speech because of the anti-Roma atrocities taking place in Italy.

Opening of the sitting
May I also stress, Commissioner and Council representatives, that this is not a political issue, as some people would have us believe.
Regrettably, the new constitution does not grant human rights, and we call on the Commission and the Council to support the UN recommendations in setting up a commission of inquiry into the human rights violations.
As well as the positive aspects, there are also negative ones, because excessive restrictions have been introduced on the movement of the residents of countries which share a border with the EU, and this means mainly the new countries, such as Poland and Latvia.
I therefore welcome the European Commission's intention to propose a specific programme to combat child poverty.
I would just say from experience that, without going into stories, I would like to see more coordination, more help between embassies in the bigger countries where they do have embassies and consuls in almost every country, so as to help all other Member State embassies with their constituents.
The IIES requires significant capacity in this area.
Statement by the President
I would like to draw the attention of fellow Members to the fact that decisions on matters related to abortion lie within the competence of the governments of individual Member States.
This means that we cannot now simply apply the number laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon, namely the 751 MEPs, given that under Lisbon a certain country loses three Members who have been elected and, therefore, cannot leave Parliament during this parliamentary term.
This is the case, in particular, for the often very complicated and disputed cross-compliance regulations.
How the public interest is served should, in my view, be assessed at national level and no compulsory market test is necessary for that purpose.
I also look forward to receiving contributions from the members of this Parliament.

Can the Commission answer the following questions: Independently of the choices made by each country, does it consider it preferable from an ecological and environmental point of view to use the option proposed by environmental organisations (WWF, Greenpeace, SOS Mediterranean, and so on) that waste should be sorted by households at source rather than recycled at waste plants?
The Regulation on accreditation and market surveillance will perceptibly increase the effectiveness of our rules for the internal market, and one of the main purpose of those rules, of course, is to guarantee the safety of products.
The first victims of this commercialised health system are the very people who work in this sector.
It is true that this may be voluntary and that it may be used as an additional tool - as already happens - in suspected cases of drug trafficking, where something is hidden in the body, but not as a replacement for a totally reasonable check which can be very useful and is accepted by everyone.

Stockholm syndrome must be treated, but not through feeble reforms, as is happening in Romania.
This agreement shows a clear desire for rapprochement between Georgia and the EU which has been expressed in recent years through a series of significant political acts, ranging from improved bilateral cooperation between the EU and Georgia to Georgia's accession to the Council of Europe and the European Convention on Human Rights.
Although it had initially appeared to be a very technical dossier, in the end, it was very clear that the political decision would find a solution for this report.
That will be a task for the future, for which a solution can only be found by putting the long-term focus on the goal of the internal market, putting an end to the fragmentation into individual directorates general and different political approaches, and actually seeing the internal market as the grand aim of the European project that we have rather neglected in recent years.
This entails Member States considering a review of their livestock rearing technologies and replacing old technologies with other, state-of-the-art and high-performance technologies, which take into account the animals' physiological needs and allow their productive biological potential to be utilised in ideal conditions, also resulting in much better food safety.
We believe this can be achieved through competition instead of planning, and through transport instead of local production.

For example, pavement weed control is 400 times more expensive without chemicals.

Let us refrain from becoming anti-tobacco ayatollahs, as a Socialist Minister in France once implored me.
I need only mention the European company and the Directive on cross-border mergers.

What is needed is the new strategy for security in the Sahel that the Council of Foreign Ministers have called to adopt, which we are awaiting.
It is partly, though, a result of the rush into biofuels: the EU proposal of a 10% increase in fuel for transport; in America, the 30% of corn crops now going into ethanol, reducing the land available for food and pushing up the price of cornflour.
I have no wish, nevertheless, to convey the impression that the Commission is indifferent to problems in connection with the production, storage and utilisation of weapons covered by the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) or the issue of inhumane weapons in general.

When I presented the priorities of the Swedish Presidency to you on 15 July, I said that the EU must emerge strengthened from the crisis.
You have a 100% record for being wrong with every single prediction about the euro and you say today that this package will put Greece on the road to growth, but no it won't.

This assessment had broadly positive results, with the exception of observations concerning a contract concluded for the provision of services.

Interoperability with other transport systems, such as public transport, would be much more important than the elaborate game of cat-and-mouse that industry is trying to play with us.

I would like to amend Esther Herranz García's proposal in that we do not need a common European position on floods but on water management, as inland inundations and floods cause as big a problem as drought, and those on the committee know only too well that there is no single European risk management basis here.
The aim is to bring about a more efficient use of resources.
Welcome
I therefore voted against this report.
It is the responsibility of the Commission to make sure that the stress tests are conducted in a solid, transparent and comprehensive manner and that they have real consequences.

We ought to encourage research and eco-innovation through the development of energy-efficient technologies, without, however, ignoring the need for a shift in our consumer habits.

If rising fuel prices are a problem, if there is an urgent need to reduce energy consumption in general, if the irresponsibly high levels of CO2 emissions need to be lowered, and if we want to do something to combat climate change, we shall not put these things to rights with a philosophy of more and more, higher and higher, faster and faster, ever more sophistication and ever more mobility but much rather by adopting a different lifestyle, in which slower, more modest and thriftier are the order of the day.

The second is respect for the rule of law, and consequently for a number of fundamental principles: the transparency of procedures, the possibility of taking legal action and the right to defence.

Fear of attacks by the PKK, anger that could lead to escalation.
We do not like how the debate has been going so far.
We are radically opposed to the liberalisation of the market in the dairy sector.
If you start with incorrect assumptions, in other words, that disputing the first instance in detail will save costs in subsequent instances, it will automatically seem as if all Member States have poor first-instance procedures.
In the wake of the failed climate change negotiations at Copenhagen, I am keen to hear how the Presidency will work with the Commission to put forward a common EU target for emissions reductions for the 31 January target.

It is particularly important that we take advantage of your privileged insight into what is really happening on the ground.
This will have to be unravelled.
It is hardly surprising, consequently, that the German Government continues to oppose CO2 limits on vehicles, that it is not in favour of the single market for energy as proposed by the Commission and that it is attempting to organise an alliance against the 'new definitions of emissions trading'.

Mr President, I too supported the Morgan report because I am convinced that we should be unbundling ownership fully in this particular sector, and the experience of Member States indicates that full ownership unbundling leads to increased investment and improved network performance.
I think that measures are required to facilitate workers' mobility in this sector without unjustified barriers and restrictions.
Something of a split might be discerned in the Court of Auditors' report: the slightly more correct northern net contributors as opposed to the southern beneficiaries that are rather more prone to abuse.

I also believe that today's debate will spur the Member States on which have not yet ratified the Convention and/or Optional Protocol to do so in the foreseeable future.
This is why I do not feel able to support what are almost one-sided inflexible attitudes to one country or another, but I do strongly support the need for enhanced monitoring of all of the problematic situations, in the spirit of the legislation in force and according to the principles of the rules on which we want to base the legislative review that we are demanding.
The fact is that we cannot afford to turn our backs on green genetic engineering.

Use of such data for other purposes, such as law enforcement, is neither legitimate nor proportional.

An auction simply takes pollution away from Europe, dumps it somewhere else, and brings us unemployment.
I do think, however, that in these circumstances it would be worth considering the use of a more radical approach, for example, using UN special forces to take the accused to the ICC, and then imprisoning those found guilty and interning them for life, with no right of return, on some distant island with some telling name such as Evildoers' Island.
Therefore, I must stick to the present system until it is changed, but we will be ready to consider all new guidelines and study them extremely carefully.

I am therefore also pleased to announce that the Commission will prepare, before the European Council in June, an analysis of which practical policies would be required to implement a 30% emission reduction by 2020.
But I am afraid some of the amendments to which the Commission has already made reference take away from the spirit of our initial intentions and the initial way in which we reacted.

Madam President, it is with great regret that I am addressing the House as a Member from a country that has not yet opted into the Schengen Agreement.

Throughout this report, Parliament shows itself to be proactive by supporting new forms of financing which need to be introduced more generally.
Finally, it is important to stress that regional planning has so far been largely land-based and has failed to take into account the impact of coastal development on certain maritime activities.

I could not say that we have noticed any substantial changes, although we are aware of the potential for change, and the potential for a new chapter in the relationship between the European Union and Cuba.

My decision to vote for the establishment of a financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised countries, which was adopted by an overwhelming majority in this House, fully supports the common line of applying Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

Access of Roma communities to the conditions required to earn their livelihood should be an important target within the concept of agricultural subsidies.

Yet the request for more disposable funds, which recurs every year, is at odds with this.
in writing. - I welcome Jens Holm's report on trade in raw materials and commodities.
Lastly, I should like to congratulate my compatriot, Mrs Ferreira, on all her commitment and dedication, which has not always been easy but is clearly commendable.

A key issue - and one that has already been discussed today - concerns the operation of nuclear power stations.

Concerning the initiative taken by the Commission on damages actions for breach of the European anti-trust rules, I can assure you that the Commission shares Parliament's view that these two initiatives related to collective redress should be consistent.
Our democracy is based on representativeness, which is put into practice through political parties.
We call on the Commission to take into consideration all these deliberations on flexibility and improved conduct of negotiations in the context of budgetary policy annually and multiannually during the deliberations on the review of the multiannual financial plan in the autumn.
The impact assessment accompanying the review proposals states that the European authority would contribute to improving the efficiency of decision-making, most of all in decision-making concerning cross-border actions.
I am sure that with the experience gathered from this project, the innovative financing tools can be used in other areas as well.
The debate is closed.
Madam President, it is always more difficult to conclude a military operation than it is to start it, and in order to be able to conclude it, we must keep in mind the initial objective, which was to ensure that the al-Qaeda camps were dismantled.
Most kinship carers are grandparents and find themselves being the main caregivers for their grandchildren, normally because the parent either has a drug addiction or has died through that drug addiction.
I have noticed two types of reaction: firstly, our citizens are wondering why the European Union is meddling with rosé, when there are so many other issues to worry about, particularly the serious issue of the economic crisis.
I hope that the possibility of reviewing the recommendations on the basis of the economic downturns can also contribute to its success, provided that it does not threaten fiscal sustainability.
I also agree that:
He leads opinion; he does not follow opinion.
We, the MEPs representing the peoples of Europe, have a duty to use our influence to respond to the request of our fellow citizens, but above all to shoulder the responsibility that we have, so that we can meet the IPCC's target of a 25-40% reduction by 2020.
The text now on the table reinforces the security of our legal chain of supply for medicinal products, but let me emphasise that only 1% of falsified medicines reach our patients via this legal chain.

Sociological research shows that the greater the percentage of migrants in the EU, the more dissatisfied local people are with their way of life.
I demand a 'Europe 2020' planning committee involving the Commission, the Member States, the European Investment Bank, the European Central Bank and Eurostat.
What is happening at this moment in time is that a large slice of intra-European tourism is heading for countries outside the European zone - the Caribbean, the developing world, the Far East, Africa - largely due to this increase in the value of our European currency.
I would like to say that it proved possible to avoid discussing issues other than adapting in this document.
Now I would like to address not only all my fellow members in this Chamber, who are about to put the final seal on our work to introduce a new maritime package, but also all the European Union citizens that you represent.
Eight is a lucky number in Chinese culture and is associated with good fortune and prosperity.
For the fifth consecutive year, Turkey has failed to comply with Europe's requests.
The opening of the secretariat in Barcelona has been postponed indefinitely, and the money promised cannot come in.
Since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament has had more powers to intervene in the conclusion of international agreements between the European Union and third countries.
(The oral amendment was accepted)
It destroyed people's moral values, traditions, solidarity, and self-confidence.
We have made clear in this report - and rightly so - that, where competition rules are infringed, Parliament stands by the view that, according to the European tradition, it is primarily the task of the authorities - both the national competition authorities and the European competition authority - to take action and that this is not creating a second arm, as it were, on an equal footing with official action in the fight against cartels.
Is it in Italy that we change the law on audiovisual advertising in favour of our friends?

Therefore it is an individual responsibility for all of us to contribute to maximise energy efficiency.
On the one hand, these measures affect the free movement of the citizens of my country and primarily the opportunities for young people to have the same rights and chance which people of their age enjoy in other countries; on the other hand, they generate economic problems for countries like Bulgaria, which have relatively small ports and will have to shoulder the heavy financial burden of providing the new screening equipment.
In June 2010, only about half the Member States had implemented the directive - more than half a year late.
in writing. - (EL) The Commission proposal on which the report has been drafted creates an information and warning network between the Member States for their public and private infrastructures which are characterised as being 'critical'.
Several rapporteurs have already mentioned that someone wants to extend the right to submit a citizens' initiative to people who are not citizens and someone else wants to be able to decide on the voting age in other Member States and so on - something that we have not been able to agree on.
It is quite logical that on occasions we might need more time to take decisions.
Mr President, I am going to answer the questions raised by Mrs Flašíková Beňová and Mrs Flautre on a matter which directly affects human rights, which affects all of us, and which also affects a large community, because the Roma population, as you are aware, is the largest ethnic minority living in the European Union, and it cannot be said that they have the same standard of living as the average European citizen.
We should not merely support but absolutely insist on respect for human rights both within the EU and in its external relations.
This report lacks ambition.
In order to do this, it is absolutely vital that we guarantee an effective system of equivalence of qualifications, not only in terms of degrees and diplomas, but in terms of training for employees throughout their working lives.
Mr Sarkozy is very obliging, and does not see that Russia has increased its military presence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
It is simply not true that all the problems we are now facing involve a tsunami, something caused by Nature.
Al Gore's infamous film confirmed that view.
in writing. - (EL) I should like once again to congratulate the rapporteur on this excellent report.
Unemployment among the under-25 age group has reached 21.4% in the EU: double that of the population average.
This is no easy task and some of the negative features of the previous system have lived on in new guises.
The revision of the timeshare directive excludes the registration of unreliable service providers and thereby increases the chances that people will not fall victim to fraud as is all too often the case today.
We are already over time.
Granting immunity to members of a legislative body, an instrument which has been disputed on countless occasions, is intended to give them the freedom to express their opinions.
(The Minutes of yesterday's sitting were approved)
Most importantly, the Commission will be obliged to indicate the exact reasons for refusal of an ECI, as well as indicating exactly how it intends to follow up on a successful initiative.
The car industry already entered into a voluntary agreement on the reduction of CO2 ten years ago and has had an enormous amount of time to adjust to the rules that are necessary if we are to combat global warming.
In my opinion, the matter of rail transport should be tackled decisively and quickly.
One solution might be the use of model contracts.
What message does the Council and Commission have for them?
I would like in particular to thank many Members for their support in organising a public hearing on the issue of 'European Conscience and Crimes of Totalitarian Communism' last week in Brussels, where we were together with Commissioner Figeľ.
Let me make that quite clear.
Reference is also made to the huge importance of ensuring that the education provided meets the needs of the labour market and provides the skills and knowledge needed by the young people of Europe.
I particularly welcome the proposal to create more jobs by encouraging employers to invest in young people.
(DE) Commissioner, I should be interested to hear your views on the situation surrounding the relevant market power exercised over such modes of distribution.
This initiative gives the European School system the opportunity to better fulfil the needs of SEN children.
Therefore, this is not the right term to use as it is misleading.
In Italy judges do not have civil liability for miscarriages of justice - this is a grave social injustice and must be put right.
I have just seen Simeon Sakskoburggotski, the former Prime Minister of Bulgaria, in the gallery.
We have no relevant national laws in many countries.
Let me remind you of two examples.
Japan is the EU's sixth largest trading partner and the EU is Japan's third largest trading partner.
Consumers must be aware of their rights.
However, implementation means that companies, farmers and local councils have to put policies into practice, which is not always easy.
Even though the first experiences from this procedure are positive, it is crucial to keep on building trust between institutions. The working relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission in this process are very important.
In some of what I believe are key areas, the report proposes criteria for selecting these projects.
I should explain that the Commission will already have representatives in Washington on Tuesday and Wednesday to start the negotiations formally.
That is why it was deemed necessary to amend Regulation (EC) No 377/2004.
The expense in terms of time and money involved in complying with these regulations is out of all proportion to the benefits for the final recipient of the funding.
Forests make up biospheres which store carbon and are particularly important to environmental conservation and protection against natural disasters.
We were the vanguard of freedom, even right next to Franco, and anyway it was not necessary to talk about borders because they were drawn by an Iron Curtain.
Undoubtedly, the clashes of the rebels in the eastern provinces will bring more and more violence, including sexual violence.
Budget discipline and the implementation of reforms must be rewarded by admission to the euro area.
I agree with the rapporteur's proposal recommending the introduction of more ambitious limit values for particulate emissions (going beyond the European Commission's proposals) in order to guarantee high levels of protection of human health and the environment, particularly with regard to mitigating the effects of climate change.
It had, in fact, been going on for many years.
This requires separately allocated radio spectrum in order to guarantee troublefree connections.
We need both these factors, Commissioner Dimas, and we shall continue to need good farming practice and integrated pest management, because we need dynamism.
It is an excellent report and it has my full support.
They did this deliberately, for shabby party-political reasons, to make it impossible for us to support the report as presented to plenary.
I therefore could not vote in favour of the report.
Madam President, I ask: is the answer yes or no?
Graham Watson asked how much we will have to pay.
Approval of Minutes of previous sitting: see Minutes
It is exceptional in that it was supplied by RosUkrEnergo, which is now out of the deal, but we are also working towards full restoration of gas supplies to all parts of the European Union that have been affected by the crisis.
I believe that these agreements are a positive step, not only because they draw a line under disputes in which the EU has been the losing party, with the ensuing consequences in economic and disciplinary terms and in terms of its institutional credibility as I already mentioned, but also because they lead to a balanced solution that respects the needs both of these ACP countries and of European producers in the outermost regions, who certainly cannot be abandoned to unbridled competition.
With regard to Croatia, conclusion of the accession negotiations, as stated in the conclusions of the European Council, is within reach, and our goal is to conclude the negotiations by the end of the Hungarian Presidency - provided of course that Croatia completes the remaining benchmarks for closing the negotiating chapters.
Aside from this particular situation, however, this decision more generally calls into question the European asylum system as a whole, particularly regarding one of its fundamental components - the Dublin regulation - and its main premise, the equivalence of national asylum systems within the Union.
What evidence does the Commission have to support this argument?
I consider, therefore, that we should refer this report back to the Committee on Development in order to agree on a legal base having the support of a clear majority of this House.
To my mind, it makes no economic sense.
I am speaking on behalf of a European and pro-Europe country, a country which, in the last 25 years, has experienced a major transformation in terms of progress and welfare, largely due to being part of the European Union.
Following Bali, it is clear that Europe, as a Union of 27 Member States, has the capacity and the ability to lead the world on this most critical of issues - climate change - with this package at its centre.
If we do not vote on them, we will not defer them to the next sitting.
I was particularly struck by Paragraph 15, in which the European Parliament 'calls on the Commission to strengthen the structural funds' potential through simplification, flexibility and improvement of procedures ... with the aims of helping Member States to optimise the output of social and employment policies and creating sustainable growth'.
This very balanced compromise text will hopefully facilitate the adoption of the proposal at a single reading.
I am referring to Mr Schmitt.
On the other hand, non-compliance with the Community rules in the field of agricultural expenses currently leads to the recovery of no less than 83 million euros by the European Commission from eleven Member States.
I would like to add that this is not only about the money, but also about taking decisive measures to counter racism.
The whole situation has gone so far that we are considering the establishment of a privatisation agency based on the German Treuhand model.
The Commission is also very interested in what is called 'the business model', which has been developed by the public-private partnerships, including the one presented by the TBVI.
It is an opportunity to reorganise the whole pan-European and global financial architecture.
Mr President, as has been said, this report includes two objects of concern.
I hope these points are convincing and that the upcoming events, especially the next conference on SSGI and poverty, will provide ample opportunities to discuss how to proceed.
How is it possible that there are between five and six million people in France living in flood zones?
The increasing concentration of media in the hands of wealthy patrons clearly stifles open debate.
I do not think there is a better place in Europe for the passion and the compassion that this Parliament can bring to bear.
We are talking about students, scientists, academics and others who, as part of their professional and/or academic work, need to travel between several Member States, and would not be able to do so under the existing legislation.
Research and development are crucially important to achieving the goals to which the European Union has committed itself under the Europe 2020 strategy.
This change can be regarded as an acid test.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 22 October 2009.
I have mentioned European actions that, unfortunately, do not bring the intended results.
I am, however, resolutely opposed to the calls for health warnings.
(Applause)
Madam President, I am aware that the current Polish government, and the Treasury Minister in particular, made a lot of mistakes last year.
I am convinced that we managed to reach a fine agreement on the issue.
In Europe, one in four women will experience physical acts of violence within her lifetime and more than one in ten will be a victim of sexual violence involving the use of force.
17.
(SK) Madam President, last week's visit by Commissioner Füle shows that the commitment of the Montenegrin Government to European integration is genuine and is the best path for a country that is moving towards the European Union.
I am not avoiding anything.
This is a serious incident.
in writing. - (PL) The creation of a common railway market for transport services requires changes to existing regulations.
Furthermore, I know from recent insolvency court cases in my own country, Ireland, and particularly in the construction sector, that the many late payments end up becoming bad debts and bring companies to their knees.
Finally, we have secured the basis for an industry with two million new jobs in Europe and research into green energy technologies, so I feel justifiably proud today.
author. - (NL) Mr President, in assessing what is happening in and around Iran at the moment, there are four issues to be considered.
Mr Barroso, I criticised you last week for demonstrating a lack of commitment.
It was also the intention of the Treaty of Lisbon and its copy, the so-called European Constitution, which the Irish, French and Dutch voted against, to do that.
Before a tsunami comes over us, we should take the measures and be proactive and prevent this type of thing from happening.
We would like to work with Russia in a constructive spirit in the search for solutions for these vexed issues.
(DE) Madam President, the borders have been removed for the first time in Germany and Austria and we finally have free movement for workers from the countries of Eastern Europe.
in writing. - Waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) represents the fastest-growing waste stream in the EU and we therefore face a range of challenges: 9 million tonnes now, growing to 12.3 million by 2020.
As for the very strange remarks by Mr Batten from UKIP and his reference to the next European elections, we shall see.
However, even in those areas that we would like to regard as areas of low-hanging fruit, as easy areas, it is impossible to reach agreement.
As a result, we must absolutely guarantee this premise.
Mr Mitchell, I do not want to say any more other than that I have a list and you can check the list.
What he wants are transparent borders - he basically wants Abkhazia and South Ossetia back - and he has, of course, also put the import ban on Georgian wines and mineral water on the agenda.
What is the substance of what you said?
I want to assure him that this is what we are doing in order to be able to combat maladministration and that the interactive guide has very much helped reduce maladministration in the institutions as a response to his question.
If the European Union wants to play an effective peacekeeping role, it needs to act now.
Mr President, at the very moment when the good people of Massachusetts were voting against excessive taxation and excessive government, our own Commission nominees were boasting of their plans to harmonise taxation in the European Union and create a separate revenue stream for Brussels.
The report that you have submitted is detailed and rich, as the Presidency pointed out.
I have followed labelling legislation for the last 15 years.
All workers have the right to work.
We agree entirely with what Jacek Saryusz-Wolski said a few moments ago about institutional improvements.
They invigorate the social dialogue between management and workers in more than 820 companies.
Furthermore, it has always played a constructive role towards regional integration in the Maghreb.

The pursuit of profit at any price has brought the financial system crashing down.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, agricultural policy needs a coherent framework.
The irregularity rate for the EU funds paid out has never been as low as in this year.
This is interference in Polish affairs and in Polish sensitivities as regards Europe, the Polish nation and religion.

(FI) Mr President, over the centuries, people have left Europe for reasons of work and to escape war and political and religious persecution, and now Europe, with its stability, attracts people from outside Europe, and that is a good thing.
It envisages appropriate funds in its draft budget for 2012 to launch an EU-wide awareness campaign, plus training schemes for officials.
Mr De Castro is right.
That is crucial if we are going to be able to continue to have a common currency.
Mr President, I voted in favour of Mrs Herczog's report on the Small Business Act.
We need to adopt a more coherent approach in dealing with the area to the east of our borders.
I am conscious that our interpreters have been here for a long time.
(DE) Madam President, for us, it is relatively easy to talk, when human rights violations take place elsewhere and people are also dying for their beliefs.
The monitoring of the funds needs to be strict.
I am naturally astounded therefore at the votes to remove some of the abovementioned points requested by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group.
Regarding the accusation of racism, it is hard to find a more ethnically diverse and less racist county than Israel, which includes Arab, Armenian, Druze and other minorities in its society.
My second remark is on justice.
It also rejects protectionism.
I agree with the opinion that the main objectives of a Black Sea strategy should entail building a space of peace, stability and prosperity in the Black Sea region, as well as ensuring EU energy security.
The Union has a very important role in the international economy but, at the same time, it is also one of the main promoters of the respect for fundamental human rights.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
There are many praiseworthy statements about anti-discrimination and the importance of equal treatment in this report which deserve attention.
All of this is being provided by the EIB.
Verification that new Member States meet the conditions necessary for the full application of the Schengen acquis is a precondition for the adoption of the Council decision to abolish border checks at internal borders, after it has consulted the European Parliament.
Unemployment is the main cause of poverty in most countries in the European Union.
You were held captive for six years, four months and nine days.
To prevent the situation from escalating I wish to refrain from commenting, other than to say that the Conference of Presidents has taken the matter in hand.
One of the current aims is to find a way of facilitating the inclusion of 'cabotage' operations by road transport - in other words, carrying out up to three transport operations following an international journey, provided that these are carried out within seven days - in a market which is already so liberalised that this will profoundly impact on the finances and survival of national operators.
We have to learn lessons.
It is true that we need a solid legal base for this Code of Conduct that will allow us to look again at the current arms embargo against China.
This is the priority if we really want to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy.
Let us not be fussy and let us welcome this progress, since we know all the administrative formalities that are carried out in our embassies in order to issue visas to citizens of countries of the South.
3. on an EU-India Free Trade Agreement (
Even in the European Parliament, not everyone is convinced that climate change is a real threat.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, as Pakistan prepares for important parliamentary elections, the situation is, as we all know, very difficult and preoccupying, and I, also, like many of you, have to express that I was deeply shocked by the heinous bomb attack and assassination attempt in Karachi, when Ms Benazir Bhutto returned to the country last week, and also by the terrible loss of life, which has affected so many innocent people.
(DE) Madam President, we football fans are currently experiencing what is good about sport: team spirit, the joy of winning and, as yesterday evening, respect for the opposing team.
Does he accept however, that it is important that help is given to lesser used languages in their own context and not to tie them in too much with lifelong learning?
(The sitting was suspended for five minutes due to technical issues)
Actually, according to the ENPI Regulation, you were already supposed to have carried out an evaluation last year.
The report that was voted on in Parliament improves the directive, in particular with regard to the equal treatment of workers from third countries, as it prevents discrimination against these workers.
The debate on the global climate is not a European debate but a global debate.
(PT) Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteurs, particularly Mr Martin and Mr Corbett, and by saying that, as a member of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), my primary concern is with the proposed amendments to the Rules of Procedure.
And let there be no illusions about this.
We hope too that if we have a negative statement of assurance, we will have a negative vote from Parliament, so that there is political consistency between the bodies that have to take budgetary control decisions.
The European Union is still the only region in the world to have limited its emissions by law.
Agriculture represents a strategic sector for the European Union.
This will certainly not be an easy task, given the delicate nature of the matter and the potential impacts of decisions taken in this context.
It would also mean that the tax domain is one where there is still work to be done to make the most of the internal market.
This situation emphasises the need for a plan to aid the recovery and re-qualification of these former employees, so as to promote their reintegration into the labour market.
I voted in favour of the Batzeli report on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the European Year of Creativity and Innovation (2009), as I believe creativity and innovation are essential for Europe to be competitive in a globalised world.
European agriculture is aware of its important role as promoter and preserver of biodiversity.
From the crisis in Greece we can see that what has happened up to now is totally inadequate.
On this latter point, the best solution would be to allocate to the fund payment appropriations in its own right, as for other funds, but we know the Council's position on this subject and I fully understand what the Commissioner said.
I must thank all the rapporteurs on this text from all the political groups, with whom we have had much discussion and very good cooperation throughout this year, as we have been working together on this for a year now.
Huge potential lies dormant in the appropriate use of these by-products.
The progress achieved over time, including through the contributions made by EU Member States, can be undone by adopting a hasty approach based on commercial considerations.
Any remaining funds had to be invested in this project.
So while it is the nature of politics to focus on today's problems today, we must not be distracted from legislating now for the longer term, for the post-2012 scenario, on this most important of issues, or history will not judge us kindly.
As regards patents obtained with public funds, it is important that universities and private persons be able to share in intellectual property created in this way.
I would like to reiterate that it is the most vulnerable populations, including indigenous peoples, who are affected by climate change, and so their participation in policymaking, especially trade policy, is essential.
Yet here we have ideologues intent on foisting their precious social agenda on everyone, even where it is unwanted.
Flexibility needs to be reconciled with security in order to avoid situations in which low-skilled workers take low-skilled jobs for a low salary.
The freedom to provide services is one of the four fundamental freedoms of the internal market.
in writing. - (SV) The reports on milk products from the Agriculture Committee are a mixed bag.
We understand that the country has internal threats to its security and that there has to be a response to these, but democracy is not a threat to security.
They are two sides of the same coin.
If we make it easier for the citizens of Eastern Partnership countries to enter EU territory, they will discover how significant the benefits of cooperation with the EU can be.
We also support the proposed exclusion of organ transplantation from the scope of this directive.
Nevertheless, we can see that a number of groups are employing considerable resources and are doing all they can to influence decision making as much as possible.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for the constructive discussion we have had on the important issue of the relationship between the environment and health.
The right-wing dictatorships in Portugal and Greece were allowed to join in, there were bilateral agreements with a similar dictatorship in Spain, and the French colony of Algeria was forced to belong to NATO territory until 1962.
Moreover, if we really want to strengthen the European Union's common energy and climate policy, this intention must also be reflected in the next seven-year budget.
The European Parliament and its committee responsible for such matters, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, chaired at the time by Karl von Wogau and then by Christa Randzio-Plath, have also had a part to play as a driving force in this historic project over the years leading from the currency snake to the creation of the single currency.
The contacts with your delegation throughout the conference proved most useful.
I am voting for this report on an EU strategy for the Black Sea.
However, it did not solve all the problems.
Obviously, the personal data of internet users, such as IP addresses, ought to be protected.
I am confident that this deadline will be met.
I would like to reiterate that it was no easy decision, and I do not even think that it was the only decision and, in the debate over a compromise, a decent basis will surely be found, or at least I hope so.
We could have lost a whole year!
In the case of Northern Rock, they have spent half the Treasury money on trying to rescue it, and who knows if that is at an end.
Not everyone is familiar with how the close cooperation between schools and industry works - the dual system, that is - and not everyone is aware of the considerable investment in terms of skills, time and cost involved in gaining a master craftsman's diploma or recognition as a 'Fachwirt' (a non-academic professional qualification).
Everything that was criticised therefore no longer appears in the resolution adopted and I wanted to make this clear.
Then, of course, we also have the European elections.
I am also pleased to see the inclusion of the youth programme as one of the priorities for the coming year in the Commission's draft, but I am disappointed that there has only been a token increase in funding, when more was expected from these initiatives.
by Georgios Stavrakakis, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Police College for the financial year 2009 (SEC(2010)0963 - C7-0241/2010 -;
I must say that the motion for a resolution that we have seen appears to be highly appropriate and, moreover, we welcome the constructive attitude not to vote on the agreements for the time being and the fact that the motion for a resolution calls for a suitable mechanism for reviewing the agreements.
Therefore, we support the conversion of Europol into an agency, with the associated increase in budgetary control.
It deserves particular recognition for the manner in which it has solved the Rubik's cube with the appointments of Mr Van Rompuy and Lady Ashton.
Some studies on gender-based violence estimate that between a fifth and a quarter of Europe's female population have been victims of acts of physical violence at least once during their adult lives, and around one tenth of them have suffered sexual violence.
One minute they are solving the issue of flooding and the next minute the issue of drought.
The joint initiatives from the EIB and Commission in support of convergence have sought to encourage SMEs to access funding, develop micro-credits with a view to economic growth and create jobs, as well as provide support for sustainable investments in urban areas.
The other main guideline for the work in strengthening measures for financial stability concerns the tools for preventing, managing and resolving crises.
This amendment by the Greens is crucial and contradicts what Mrs Lynne depicted here as an illusion.
We know the goal that we need to get to, and we have to recognise that sustainability is a process that needs to have clear goals, but not all countries can move at the same pace. Those who have not yet begun to advance cannot be asked to do the same as the rest.
It is only the College of Commissioners that takes positions that are binding on the Commission.
That is where the contradiction in your statement lies.
The EU still seems to be an eldorado in the eyes of many illegal immigrants; they often find work and a quality of life here which they cannot find in their own country.
For this reason, we have drawn up Amendment 47, and I would ask for your support for this amendment in the interests of the developing countries.
With regard to socio-economic issues, he did not put forward anything different, which means maintaining the neo-liberal positions, the proposals rejected by the European Parliament on the Working Time Directive, the Stability and Growth Pact and the neo-liberal Lisbon Strategy, and he ignored the economic crisis and its serious consequences in the social dimension.
Thank you very much for your attention.
Fourthly, is the Commission satisfied with the level and frequency of inspections and supervision imposed by the Member State on this plant and its produce, given the Member State's obligation to have a risk-based official control plan?
In that sense, what Commissioner Dimas said here about the relationship between flexibility and effective implementation is extremely important.
I would like in particular to applaud the immediate public reaction of Commissioner Georgieva, who arrived in Santiago yesterday to visit the areas concerned.
This affair may bring unpleasant consequences in six months time in the elections to the European Parliament.
Jo, you were saying that if we did not vote this afternoon, the vote would take place next time.
The report submitted to you today and adopted unanimously by the members of the Committee on Development seems to me to represent a first step towards this necessary revision.
We are proceeding cautiously together with the social partners to see how changes might be made to the Swedish labour market model, but not in order to detract from it or to make fundamental changes to the way it works.
Welcome to Parliament.
(DE) Madam President, the Member States, Europol and Eurojust will now have to concern themselves on a regular basis with OLAF's findings.
Europe must take charge of this, and the European Union must focus its attention and efforts, including its economic efforts, in those areas that receive the most immigrants.
Deep-sea fisheries started in the late 1970s, developing rapidly from the 1990s onwards as a result of three factors.
I welcome the possibility granted to the Commission to adopt, in clearly defined cases, delegated acts under the urgency procedure in this regard.
As a global power in agricultural production, the EU needs to take account of and effectively adapt to emerging challenges, such as extreme weather conditions, limited availability of natural resources, dependence on food imports and increasing speculation in commodities.
Cohesion policy is a key policy for the EU.
Our economic and historical analysis suggests that this should be done in two ways: first, we need a family policy that will bring the birth rate back up, otherwise we shall not be able to fund our pension schemes in the decades ahead and, secondly, we need a policy to re-energise the single market and get people back to work.
Therefore, please vote in favour of our amendment not to include thrombin as an additive in our food regulation.
I hope we have not been too demanding on the Commissioner, because I think we will certainly be meeting him during future Parliamentary terms, and Mr Piebalgs has really worked very hard to make it possible even to speak of a European energy market.
A strong leader is required.
This right is enshrined in the treaties, including the Treaty of Lisbon.
Secondly, at a time of scarce public funding, the charging for external costs provided by the new directive will generate revenues and make new financial resources available for transport infrastructure.
Furthermore, it is obvious for this reason that the Schengen system - currently the 'one for all' Schengen system and soon to be Schengen II - must be equipped with the best technology.
I would like once again to thank the French Presidency, which has not only showed will, but has also proven its intelligence.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report by our Liberal colleague Olle Schmidt relates to a new confrontation between the House and the European Commission, which has proposed an unjustifiable increase in indirect taxes.
Thus, I am saying to the Spanish and Italian Members in particular that believe me, we do devote great attention to the equality, importance and use of languages.
Hitherto, there has been a fragmented patent system in the European Union, caused by the high costs and complexity of validating patents in individual Member States.
The EU has undertaken to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20%, to reduce energy consumption by 20% and to generate at least 20% of the energy consumed from renewable sources by 2020.
The post-crisis economic world will have coalesced into several economic power centres.
I am thinking of citizens who have huge difficulties in obtaining accurate information, and of the exit penalties - often in the form of high abandonment costs - which confront users wishing to switch from one credit institution to another.
That scam has already caused student riots.
It is something that should be raised in the context of the economic and social governance of Europe.
Baroness Ashton has the dubious honour of being the first EU official to combine a career in the Commission with a position in the Council of Ministers.
I think there are concerns still remaining about funding, to make sure that this House sees the results of this strategy that it deserves.
Individual Member States realise that more must be done to help this sector, which contributes greatly to economic growth.
The EU 2020 Strategy indeed has good intentions, in particular to reduce poverty, but it is a soft, voluntary option and governments will only follow it if they really want to and have the time.
I therefore agree with what Mr Lehtinen said in his speech.
Mr President, I hope that the House and you will allow me this short indulgence to congratulate you on the statement you have made on behalf of David Kato who was murdered in Uganda.
The 'EU Pilot' project, which was launched a year ago in 15 Member States to test the new method for reaction to complaints, could be extended to the other Member States, but the lack of information on assessment of its operation does not, unfortunately, allow Parliament to comment on this issue.
As a result, one of the most effective measures would be to increase pay through a fair distribution of income.
The free public expression of opinion and ideas is a guarantee of participation in the democratic process and makes possible free and fair elections and good governance.
(Applause)
The Joint Undertaking is in a start-up phase and had not yet fully established its internal control and financial reporting systems by the end of 2009.
This opinion relates to the proposal for a regulation on the effective enforcement of budgetary surveillance in the euro area.
Among these, Parliament expresses a wish for innovation not to be limited to technological aspects, but also to cover administrative, organisational and social innovations.
This will be a matter for very concrete work by the Commission.
I believe that it is time, beyond focusing on university studies or on professional training, as we have been doing, for us to concentrate on early childhood learning.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Commissioner, these are some of the expectations citizens have of the next G20, where Europe must speak with one voice, with determination and conviction.
In this regard, it is necessary to ensure that the information is accurate and complete.
The status of European citizens must not be used to settle the issue of the status of the Member States and even less so to revive tensions within them that are already strong.
I fully agree with the rapporteur on this.
Moreover, the Lisbon Treaty increases the degree of democratization, increasing the power of national parliaments and introducing the codecision procedure for most of the fields.
Taxpayers' money was wasted and we should not repeat this mistake.
author. - Mr President, Staff Sergeant Gilad Shalit has now been held hostage by the Jihadi fanatics of Hamas for over three years.
Many of us hope that the Home Secretary, Jacqui Smith, will now intervene on the basis of new evidence.
Everything we are hearing from the Commission at present - that is, every couple of months - indicates, however, that internal logic is showing that we need a revision of the European budget to demonstrate to the public that we have indeed understood, that we want to change things, that we need new priorities, that we want to spend more on research and development, and that we need new propulsion technologies.
(PL) Mr President, the extent of trade is indicative of the level of economic development.
However, we must not forget the earthquake in May and the destruction that left many tens of thousands dead and made millions homeless.
We completed negotiations on all of the key legislative proposals which the Presidency established as its objectives.
In this regard, the authorities of a state which makes no provision for divorce and which does not recognise the type of marriage in question will not be obliged to dissolve that marriage.
It improves the quality of public services, but most of all it opens up opportunities for industry to take the lead in international markets.
This document contains the draft of a budget reform for the period 2013-2020 which represents a U-turn in budget policy.
In the current situation it is absurd to settle more immigrants in Europe in such a forcible manner.
It sets the ceiling for financing, lists eligible countries and defines the extent of the support available to them.
But we have tried to address the issue of leakage in this report, making clear that it is absolutely unacceptable if there was a risk to human health.
There is no mixing of our two approaches - the industry approach, which includes the Toys Directive and the approach on which I base my activities, which includes a general product safety directive.
That should and must be done.
We now realise that these questions were probably justified.
This time, however, democracy won, because the biggest groups found common ground and the result achieved has the genuine support of the majority.
- Before the vote:
I am sure that the Commission will return to this later.
It has helped us open up national borders by sending a clear message to criminals that they may no longer flee to another country to avoid prosecution.
(PL) Mr President, I am impressed by this report's comprehensive approach.
All that is left for me to say is thank you all for this constructive and useful debate.
Therefore, we should raise the alarm in every instance of drastic violations in this area.
(PT) Madam President, those who are pushing Portugal into this supposed aid do not really want to help, rather they want to make money by sinking us and sinking the euro.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, we have heard today a clear message that we have a very serious challenge - that of the ageing of society.
It is also, and this is even more important, a more political budget, since we have - as Mrs Guy-Quint calls it - interinstitutional strategic programming, in other words, all of the bodies of the European Union agree to bring the budget into being.
In total, 33 pollutants (mainly pesticides and heavy metals) found in rivers, lakes and coastal waters will be subject to environmental quality standards.
Several presidencies tried very hard to break the stalemate but, after some years, the proposal was - well, maybe not really dead, but at least in a coma.
We know that many people without documents are exploited and live in miserable conditions.
If we want these regulations to prevent the rise in CO2 emissions, instead of encouraging them, sanctions are required.
I believe that it is desirable to implement this treaty as soon as possible as it will ensure that the EU operates more efficiently, more transparently and, above all, more democratically.
I know it is just a small part of the overall situation, but it will make such a positive difference to so many lives.
It is hard for them to evaluate the advice given and they may therefore be misled, falling victim to unfair selling practices
We should remember that only when many basic problems of everyday life have been solved will we be able to concentrate on the economic development of the Middle East and on close commercial cooperation with the region.
Better, more intensive cooperation encourages the exchange and dissemination of knowledge, both in business and in academia.
If Turkey cannot move forward with its internal democratic constitution, I believe that we will still have serious problems in some areas, quite apart from the deadlock in the Council.
That is very important.
It is time for the European Union to invest more in the field of research and innovation.
In line with this approach, the Council confirmed its commitment to protecting those who are most vulnerable in its conclusions on the situation of the girl child, which the Council adopted last year.
And if they have eased sufficiently, what sort of timescale are you talking about for the necessary reforms to be implemented in full so that the full negotiation process can get back on track?
(PL) Mr President, I would like to congratulate Iceland very sincerely on gaining candidate country status.
I welcome the pragmatic approach which has characterised these early contacts.
Vasile Bran's election was unjustifiably invalidated by the decision of the local council, while Iulian Mara could not take the oath as the decision which validated his position was contested through administrative legal proceedings by the Prefect's Institution for Braşov County.
France and Britain - two nation states - took the lead.
It should not involve any sort of legal hairsplitting.
The failure to act, President Van Rompuy, President Barroso, is feeding ammunition to Mr Farage and his allies.
We should not forget that, most of the time, migration is a consequence of poverty and the migration phenomenon itself generates instability and conflicts.
The key to the entire policy on Lebanon lies in Damascus.
It is true that the European Union needs a common asylum policy and needs to develop an attitude of solidarity in relation to admitting refugees.
As for the Blue Card, we must be able to welcome migrant workers, while making sure we do not pillage countries by holding on to the players needed for their development.
I also have reason to believe that increasing numbers of people disagree with that approach.
So could you please tell us also how you would guarantee that the European Commission, under your Presidency, would avoid the tendency - that sometimes is all too visible - of over-regulating rather than deregulating or better regulating?
I believe that this proposal fits in perfectly with the European Action Plan for Sustainable Production and Consumption and, consequently, with the general aim of developing a voluntary, integrated system that will encourage companies to improve their products with a view to improving product quality in terms not only of diet and consumer protection, but also of the environment, by achieving higher standards of energy efficiency and environment-friendliness.
I would like to emphasise that as well as meeting genuine market demand and expanding the range of products on offer, we must help to improve the already difficult situation of producers.
We are at the stage of the first reading of the draft directive on consumer rights, submitted by the Commission.
Domestic violence incidents are estimated to affect 1 200 000 people every year, yet only 1% of the victims of violence are brave enough to report it to the authorities.
The first victim was Greece, followed by Spain and Portugal.
Firstly, we must increase the safety standards of the existing power stations, in particular, using the stress tests that are currently carried out in the Member States.
European Union law recognises this, as you have laid out, Commissioner.
The European Parliament supports the rights of drivers and refuses any competition between salaried and self-employed drivers.
Since then it has been repeatedly said that somehow we are not succeeding.
In fact, the modelling of relations between the Commission and Parliament is - rightly, in my view - derived from this, in the manner that has already been tested and whipped into shape over decades (if not centuries) in each of the Member States.
The existing budget line needs some money and some credibility.
Madam President, on behalf of my group, I should like to table an oral amendment to this paragraph.
The US should drop its extradition request and let him be prosecuted, if at all, in the UK.
Secondly, I believe it is important to ensure greater support and provision of services for patients and their families.
But we are not using the 'catch the eye' procedure.
In this context, there is some concern at proposals regarding access to resources that aim to promote a system of transferable individual quotas, which would have consequences in terms of the concentration of fishing activity and the individual appropriation of fishing rights.
Another 500 will lose their jobs in the coming month, with a further 1 500 workers threatened further down the line.
I should also like to remind you that, obviously, these two agreements go hand in hand, as, on the basis of the common approach, in principle, an agreement on facilitation of the issuance of visas can only be concluded if a readmission agreement exists.
All investment agreements must be accompanied by a set of appropriate environmental and social rules as a form of additional guarantee.
What happens is that there is a petition for a referendum, then, when enough people have put their name to it, there is the possibility of a referendum.
Your personality has very much left its mark on these decades and you have made a significant contribution to shaping the development of Parliament.
I therefore also regard it as legitimate to ask whether the analysis promised by the European Commission, concerning a reduction of the administrative burden to 25% of its current level, is available yet.
Providing Minsk is really willing to improve cooperation with the EU, this should create more favourable conditions for the kick-off of mutual discussions, not only externally but also domestically.
denounces the frequent lack of any parliamentary scrutiny over the negotiation and approval of these agreements, with national parliamentary approval only being required in seven Member States;
Thank you very much Mr President.
This is why I consider it absolutely necessary to launch the 'Safer Internet' programme in order to protect children who are using the Internet and new technologies.
(The President cut off the speaker)
I think we have succeeded in drawing up a suitable plan with this gas compromise.
Air transport agreements now fall within this category because they cover a field to which the ordinary legislative procedure applies.
Because we need to find funding for these priorities, we need, of course, to monitor unnecessary spending and administration costs.
Since this is a political failure - a failure to execute the will of the legislator - the regulation must be amended, and we intend to fight for this.
This is the truth of the matter.
I firmly believe that this approach creates another form of fundamental discrimination in relation to the Roma.
Discrimination against women or men who freely choose to assist those who cannot look after themselves, or to bring up future generations, is now anachronistic and old fashioned.
The great German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe once wrote, 'Knowing is not enough; we must apply.
What conclusions can we draw?
However, we must make sure that we do not rush forward blindly, for the provisions in the treaty on the subsidiarity principle must continue to be respected.
Nevertheless, a number of principal points make us very anxious.
The financial economy is global in nature.
In other words, when calculating whether the threshold area is reached, one must include areas in which no building works are actually taking place, but which are indisputably part of the project and part of the impact of the project.
We would be outside.
Election observers and foreign journalists must be allowed into the country.
In Italy, and in a large part of Europe, freight and passenger transport share the same lines; at present there are few sections dedicated to freight.
We need to know whether the European Union will be able, one day very soon, to have a seat in the United Nations, whether it will be able to have a seat, as the European Union, at the G20, whether it wants greater fiscal and social harmonisation, and what resources it wants to put into the European economic circuit so that it can truly do what its other international competitors have done.
This outlook cannot be changed easily in the former Communist zone where, as a result of the propaganda efforts of the regime, the collective mentality has adopted a totally artificial model of equality.
I think we should demand stricter standards for the recycling of electrical and electronic equipment.
Our common European values nevertheless allow us to build a European foreign policy that relies on sustainable development and human rights.
The scientific world tells us that international criteria must now be changed because, through the strict application of often obsolete criteria, too many patients who have other forms of dementia are often included.
Access to the EU for millions more people from some of the poorest and most corrupt countries in Europe will enable them to cross the first barrier in gaining illegal entry to Britain.
Common rules and standards for ship inspection and survey organisations and for the relevant activities of maritime administrations (recast) (
Well, we have our two pygmies.
We feel, however, that it is better to consider such targets within each individual policy initiative in the framework of the strategy.
The CESR will be the single entry point for registering agencies and it will initially play a coordinator role.
It is just as important to improve the medical care system for pregnant women and to inform them about the effects of smoking and drinking.
The real solution to the complex problems and dangers that menace the people of the region has to come about through demilitarisation, respect for national laws and the sovereignty of the people, and genuine cooperation that aims at the resolution of the profound social problems that they are facing.
Likewise, this cannot form a way of preventing farmers, due to technical or other errors of which they are unaware, from getting the support to which they are entitled, as has sometimes happened in Portugal with satellite recognition and identification.
That is why I think we should work to reach the largest possible consensus with the current instruments.
I fully support the calls in the resolution for rapid action, notably to establish marine protected areas.
Needless to say, a great deal of thought has gone into such a system in each country.
Therefore, among the report's recommendations - all of which are very important - I should like to highlight that of amending the Directive on the implementation of the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation by including references to the pay gap, and also that of amending the framework agreement on part-time work, which is where the differences are greatest.
Likewise, projects financed under the thematic programme for migration and asylum generally count as ODA.
President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, one thing that was mentioned at the beginning was whether we should contact Hamas.
Could I invite the Commissioner to take up with the European Central Bank the concerns I have raised to see who it is who is using such large quantities of EUR 500 notes?
Is this type of action definitely in accordance with the subsidiarity principle which operates in the European Union?
Honourable Member, the question is an extremely delicate one: if Mr Albertini, who is always very generous, would like to buy us a coffee, we could discuss it and hear the experience of a mayor of a large European city.
Recently some pictures have been published about where it is produced.
I am chairing this sitting, not Mr Cohn-Bendit.
Not any kind of consumption, however.
In cases where there are various conflicting interests, we have a duty to protect our consumers, regardless of the interests of large distributors or individual lobby groups.
The relevant provisions of international law actually state that if even one of the states parties to the agreement does not accept the international agreement then the agreement is not binding in that form.
(HU) Mr President, the rapporteur has done an excellent job.
In view of this economic downturn affecting the whole of Europe, I believe that national governments and the European Commission must join efforts to support the car industry.
Moreover, the Presidency puts emphasis on achieving progress in Chapter 15 on energy, in compliance with energy issues, because it is one of our priorities.
rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, I thank all my colleagues who have contributed to what has been a very lively debate here this evening and certainly had some rough edges.
Finally, the fourth pillar is the definition and creation of a real network of strategic terminals.
The European Union has not yet made any decision on the candidacy of Kazakhstan for the OSCE Chair in 2009.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as has been said previously, the earthquake in Chile, which was more intense than the one suffered by the Haitians and which was also followed by a tsunami, was nonetheless much less deadly, thanks to an early warning system that worked, to populations that were better prepared for disasters and to a robust state that was able to react.
However, we found many of the candidates disappointing in terms of their specialist knowledge.
This way, the required labour force in third countries will be reduced.
We must see to it that we create an internal market.
(FR) Mr President, I am very sorry to hear the consequences of the earthquake in your country.
For that reason, the EU has recently reaffirmed its commitment, in the context of the overall ODA commitment, to meet collectively the target of providing 0.15-0.20 of GNP to the LDCs.
(The sitting was opened at 9 a.m.)
We need to be clear on this: human beings have a right to life from the moment the egg and the sperm fuse until their natural death, and this amendment fundamentally brings that right to life into question.
Joining the World Trade Organisation is a significant achievement, which is also an important precondition for creating a proper free trade area for us and Ukraine.
For us social democrats, a consistently high level of safety was the top priority objective.
We know that concluding these negotiations means taking difficult political decisions, but we welcome the leadership shown by those ACP regions and countries which have decided to join us in initialling EPA agreements.
However, in some European countries, the level of tolerance for sexual minorities is still too low.
The deal goes like this: 'I need a revision of the treaty for the Stability Pact'.
Specifically with a view to meeting the challenges of globalisation, the European Union must adhere to its core principles, as the only way to safeguard its competitiveness in the long term.
Otherwise, it will continually be under the threat of collapse, and separatist movements, movements in individual island groups, religious and cultural movements that oppose each other will threaten the unity of the country.
Every euro that we spend in this area repays the whole of society not that many years later.
And when the Germans accepted, they then said that Italy was chairing the European Union for these six months, so they had to be there.
We want a growing European economy.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, I am here today on behalf of President Barroso, who asked me to pass on his regrets that he is unable to attend this debate on our 2007 annual report on monitoring the application of Community law.
The Commission urgently needs to stop taking random initiatives without serious assessment of their impact; it needs to examine the situation in all the arts and cultural sectors, in conjunction with all the stakeholders, and to adopt a comprehensive policy that will reflect the requirements of cultural diversity, as well as Europe's values and the Lisbon Strategy objectives based on the knowledge and innovation economy; and it needs to present Parliament and the Council with coherent draft directives respecting the principles that I have mentioned.
One of the most important factors is the development of trans-European networks, not only in the transport but also in the energy sector, by allocating sufficient financial resources to value-added projects for Europe.
Therefore, let us say from our side that the barriers must be removed.
It must be equally clear, however, that there are certain ground rules in police work.
It is important to realise that for every job that is held in the motor industry itself there are another five in associated areas and industries that depend on it.
Clearly, accusing a Member State or individual without revealing the sources for that accusation is a principle which is admissible in a parliamentary report but not in a judicial investigation.
In the final vote, I voted against this report, which was worthy of support in many ways.
The Court of Auditors published its report last November and that report was considerably better than in previous years, owing to the fact that this time, the report cited percentages.
It is simply necessary to consider not only sanctions in case of late payment, but also to try preventatively to develop an informal culture of early payment.
The creation of a unified portal will take time, but we should move in that direction.
Now there are amendments tabled by you, Mr Stevenson, one of them jointly with Mrs McGuinness, which propose that the system be made voluntary.
When even the humanitarian organisations and the United Nations have to stop their work because the warring parties do not observe their neutrality, we have reached an unacceptable low point with regard to international law and humanity.
I also welcome the 2009-2012 audit strategy of the Court of Auditors, which aims to maximise the global impact of its audits and increase efficiency through better use of resources.
Genuine asylum seekers should seek refuge in the first safe country; one that will be culturally, religiously and ancestrally related to them.
The dynamism of economic reforms has long been undermined by authoritarian regimes by means of increased state repression.
I am also in favour of the differentiated granting of quotas that you propose.
Contemporary development poses serious challenges before marine countries, and not only before them.
Meanwhile, journalists are now also being threatened with the death penalty by the State.
deputising for the author. - Given the fact that we live in an increasingly digital world, as you have acknowledged, where so much of our daily business is carried out online, one group that, in my view, has been left behind are older citizens, who have limited or no access to the Internet.
Lastly, I fully agree with Mrs Berès's call for quality jobs.
Parliament must take responsibility for elaborating and adopting a framework regulation that is binding on all Member States.
The longer this situation lasts, the longer European rights holders - in particular the creative sector (authors, composers, performers, songwriters and phonogram producers) - will be deprived of the legal tools they need to stop the large-scale online infringement of their rights in Canada.
We are showing that we are a leader in this battle.
Over the last year, the external value of the euro has been highly stable.
The assessment is focusing too much on where the money is going and too little on results.
I was, however, really quite disappointed with Commissioner Füle's appraisal that cooperation in the Arctic region was progressing gradually.
(DE) Madam President, many are delighted about the European Football Championship in June 2008.
I know your views and I know that you say now '1, 2, 3'.
I should like to say a word about Cuba.
Europe 2020 must begin here and now and should not be just a catalogue of objectives.
The requirement to obtain an independent assessment of a product would not guarantee that our children would all play with safer products, because in any case, consumers would opt for the cheapest goods.
It is therefore necessary for us to respond decisively to this phenomenon, which is nothing other than organised criminal activity.
It evaluates the Commission's monitoring of the application of European Union law in 2008.
The amounts adopted are exactly the same as those proposed with no real room for the Council to negotiate, hardly reassuring in terms of the negotiability of future budgets.
I believe that many member countries, including my own, have to make progress on quality criteria and on quality of care information.
The ongoing reform of the CAP should aim to achieve more sustainable, more intelligent and more inclusive growth for Europe's rural areas.
(DA) Mr President, Parliament has today chosen to formally recognise agriculture as a strategic sector in the context of food security.
Europe is the largest provider of aid in the world.
However, its success resulted in unintended overproduction and surpluses which distorted the market and raised environmental concerns.
The Erika III package thus covers several stages in maritime transport, with true complementarity between the various proposals - it is an overall approach that led us to view each of our reports as forming part of an indivisible whole.
As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) on this report, I have had the opportunity to work constructively with the rapporteur.
I would once again call on the Commission to take action in relation to this issue.
That would be a violation of European Union law (discrimination on grounds of nationality), as it would be if the company were undermining British legal requirements, which it must observe under the Posted Workers Directive.
(ES) Mr President, the information that you are giving us is correct, but we as Members of this House, and most definitely the citizens of Europe, get the impression that there is a very dangerous gap in Community law.
I refer to the protection of consumers involved in electronic commerce, known as e-commerce.
It was extremely difficult to explain to people why humanitarian assistance can be provided to citizens of countries outside of the EU, but not to EU Member States.
President Barroso said it himself: every year there are over 1.25 billion movements of persons within the Schengen area.
The vote will take place on Wednesday, 19 January 2011.
Let us look at what the science tells us.
The new territorial dimension is now set as a permanent objective under Articles 13 and 174 of the new Treaty of Lisbon.
It is not enough for EU fishing ships to adopt environmentally friendly practices and the codes of conduct set out by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations: it is crucial that the same position be adopted by all those cooperating in the area covered by the agreement.
Use by Parliament of the symbols of the Union (new Rule 202a) (debate)
Nor should we accept heel-dragging over the need to protect the planet.
It is bad enough to see the airport, schools and sewerage systems blown up; it is worse to rebuild them with European money knowing that they will likely be destroyed once again.
Today's left-wing ideology is completely blind to issues of religious freedom in different parts of the world.
The question is essentially in four parts and I shall reply to each of them in turn.
First of all, we should underline that the Commission has been supporting Member States in preparing the transposition of the directive.
Our vote against the section introducing enhanced cooperation bears witness to our strong opposition to this matter.
A policy to prevent and combat human trafficking is a fundamental issue at the heart of the EU.
This is unacceptable and this is why there are more protests against the necessary measures than would normally be the case.
Its procurement procedures for several projects have been fraught with errors, which corresponds to the significant amount of EUR 30 million.
This serves to ensure greater exploitation of labour forces and control over ever scarcer natural resources, particularly hydrocarbons, as well as control of the markets.
The committee is initiating the procedure during this legislative term.
It is there, close to the citizens, that innovation occurs and that our funds, the Structural and Cohesion Funds but also the research funds, are being used.
Basically, although a large number of amendments appear on paper, today we are confining ourselves to just one - Amendment 63, which is the one that sums up the spirit of the compromise.
This idea is central to the market orientation that has been achieved by the past reforms.
We are responsible for the conferences on climate change due to take place in Poznań and Copenhagen in the near future, and for the success of the post-Kyoto negotiations.
I mentioned the increasing importance of supra-national structures in today's world.
I believe he failed to listen to the concerns of farmers, particularly European Union farmers, and the food industry, and dismissed their voice by claiming that the development part of the agenda was to the fore.
Having said that, the situation of women in Saudi Arabia is dreadful, and something needs to be done urgently.
Mr President, could I take this moment to reflect on the murder in Northern Ireland on Saturday of a young police constable on his way to work, just a few weeks qualified to do the job.
However, I must say that there are some aspects to the way in which certain people are exploiting these events that I find quite intolerable.
Needle-stick injuries are the most common and most dangerous form of medical sharp injuries.
in writing. - The report of Sajjad Karim contains a legislative resolution of the European Parliament on the proposal for a Council regulation on denominations and technical specifications of euro coins intended for circulation.
We strongly oppose this Free Trade Agreement with the Republic of Korea because it would present our Korean competitors with undue competitive advantages.
It is not only about Belarus.
The conciliation has indeed failed, but not the chance to rebuild the dialogue, starting today.
We cannot afford that sort of thing now.
We welcome the Commission's European Economic Recovery Plan.
There is a need to act here.
This could be done through our increased participation in the International Monetary Fund and communication with the World Bank.
Another set of Parliament proposals has been discussed in depth at the Council and the compromise reflects all those different opinions.
I think that, bearing in mind the experiences from the past, the European Union and Canada will manage to resolve as many of these issues as possible.
This of course applies to Russia, but also to all partners and neighbours of the EU.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, during the hearing of the Commissioner-designate, I heard a very specific commitment regarding combating human trafficking.
The European Union should develop general guidelines on religious freedom as a matter of urgency.
I also support the Ombudsman in his following primary objectives: to ensure that the European Union's citizens will enjoy the benefits and resources of the Treaty of Lisbon and to achieve better cooperation with national and regional ombudsmen, thereby ensuring greater transparency of activity at European level.
There is a need to capture greenhouse gases through sustainable forest management and a change in production standards and consumption, as well as through land use.
The Agency should have adequate powers to achieve its tasks and I was able to support the report which ensures these powers whilst guaranteeing the independence of national regulators.
- Report: Janowski
on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, this report allows Parliament to outline our views before the Commission brings forward its proposals on the future of the CAP by the end of this year.
Although I agree with the need to ensure that women participate in the EU and national programmes, I do not think it should be done through quotas.
These are largely taken for granted.
(MT) Thank you, Madam President.
Not only do we use products that exhaust and damage the environment and then also fail to deal with them properly once we no longer want them, we also dump the hazardous waste, which damages the health of innocent people, often children, and makes the land and water in other countries toxic for generations to come.
And lastly, I find it important to mention the importance of a deep understanding of cultural heritage, so that communities living together can recognise and respect each other's cultural values.
This Committee would be assigned the task of establishing a strategic legislative programme on the use of radio spectrum.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, it would be difficult for me to answer all the questions raised, but I would like to emphasise a couple of points.
Mr President, the announcement, in any country, of the first elections to be held for 20 years usually fills us with optimism.
in writing. - To date, the EU still does not have an adequate response to Alzheimer's, neither has it concluded a single policy on its prevention.
I am not convinced of the need to create a European independent authority to fix toll levels, and would argue that this falls under the domain of subsidiarity.
This rule also applies when talking about food safety.
The facility for there to be just one recognised translation gives us a practical solution.
This proposal is lukewarm at best and has nothing to do with the diagnosis you correctly offered and with which I agree.
His own-initiative report covers all the key problems and does so quite outstandingly.
There is no doubt that the West - in other words, Europe and the US - should maintain its position as the global leader in the areas of research, innovation and development.
To close, I call on you Madam President, as a female president, to circumvent the rules and to give the floor to the remaining ten female speakers for this special ceremony for Women's Day.
