The principle of subsidiarity, multi-level governance, strategic planning and simplified implementation of the regional policy must be linked effectively in order to achieve an ideal balance between quality, performance and financial control.
It has offered us a mirror - which, I think, was very much needed - for asking important questions, such as how ready we are to complement the aspirations of emerging democracies, how far we are ready to go to deal with the situations like the one we face in Libya, and how long we should make compromises here and there and associate stability with autocracy, accepting that we have not always had the values in the same place as our interests.
In this regard, there are five points that I would like to make concerning areas where we may be able to make further improvements.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, a large potential for new exporting opportunities lies in the Asian markets that have high growth rates but also, of course, high barriers to entry.
I wish you all success for the ratification process.
I would also remind them that, while people in countries outside the market economy, under the shelter of the Berlin Wall, met their well-documented fate, globalisation and the market economy enabled Western Europeans to prosper at an average rate of 2% growth per annum.

Oral explanations of vote
Lastly, we must encourage insurance companies to intervene as quickly as possible and subsequently learn lessons from such events when it comes to issuing planning permission.
However, that support should be given to genuine democratic forces and we should never intentionally assist an organisation such as the Muslim Brotherhood in establishing a theocratic dictatorship in Egypt by giving it the EU's support.
Let us not forget that it is not only important that functional items be appropriately designed and that safe materials be used for their manufacture; it is equally important that common sense be applied while using them, and that children who have access to them be properly supervised.
A recent Eurobarometer poll indicated that whilst 72% of EU citizens say the European Union is 'playing a positive role in creating new job opportunities and fighting unemployment,' only a little over a third of respondents had heard of the EU's tools to combat unemployment, such as the European Social Fund and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.
What opportunity did we actually have to present that?
The rapporteur is, however, aware that the Greens have retabled their own amendments seeking to update the line between Munich city and Munich airport, but the rapporteur would like to reiterate the point that the changes we are making in this report are about correcting the text, not updating it.
European institutions are failing spectacularly to understand the nature of the problem.
Once ENISA has been modernised, the latest information will be gathered from European countries, there will be encouragement to share best practices and the European Union and the Member States will be better prepared to prevent, detect and respond more effectively to network and information security problems.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner Vassiliou, Minister Bachelot-Narquin, last week I attended a presentation of a new website on patient rights in all the EU languages, organised by my Danish colleague in the ALDE Group, Karen Riis-JÃ¸rgensen.

The elections in Poland in 1989 are an example.
Integration in the Baltic region is patchy.
The man who claims to have saved the world is about to come here in a couple of hours' time but, leaving that aside, it is to the national governments - in Paris or London or Washington or Rome - that the citizens of those countries (who also happen to be told that they are citizens of Europe) look to save them, not this larger entity called the EU.

The first example I would like to give is that, according to Eurostat, 90% of EU citizens are in favour of families consisting of a wife, a husband and their children.
(LT) Madam President, probably everyone would agree that information is one of the main driving forces in the modern world.
The Members who want to ask questions are not the ones who are responsible for the fact that we are running so late.
Secondly, we are always hearing, and we have heard in this debate too, that we, the European Parliament, have to stick our necks out at first reading and take particularly demanding positions, as the Council will subsequently put the brakes on anyway, and in the end we shall not get where we want to go.
Thirdly, solidarity must of course also apply to the developing countries.
Similar lapses today could lead to the banning of political parties and trade unions, which will be a real blow to democracy, the rule of law and civil liberties.
What this means is that we need to work within the framework of international private law and not within the substantive framework of family law, wherein each State will continue to have its own laws.
This is the truth of the matter; this is how things are.
in writing. - (DE) We expressly support Croatia's swift accession to the European Union.
As a representative of this House, let me say that we wish the AAL programme the greatest success.

Yes, I am defending Germany.

The response cannot and should not be on a case by case basis.
Madam President, fellow Members, Members of the Commission, we all know that economic globalisation, the international financial crisis and all future challenges must be addressed at the global level.
We are now in a global economic condition with the global recession where there are the beginnings of the whiff of protectionism coming from the developed world, especially from the United States, and I hope not from the European Union.
What is it that makes you so nervous?
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission welcomes the report presented and the support given to our perspectives regarding the ecosystem approach.
The measures proposed by Mrs Batzeli in her report are aimed at reducing the pressures exerted by supermarkets and promoting a direct relationship between consumers and producers.
On the one hand, the lack of rules opens the door to many cases of inhumane practices involving immigrants.
We would point out that this involves expanding the features of the SIS by developing them, extending access to new authorities and interlinking them, with the addition of new categories of data (such as the data capture mandate and biometric data).
We have to remember, however, that today we have also just had a very serious discussion about the crisis in Europe's car industry, and this week we will also be dealing with problems in the textile industry and European Globalisation Adjustment Fund aid as compensation for the massive layoffs in that sector in Spain and Portugal.
So to apply the instruments which we have in the most effective manner possible will need a strategic approach, of course - mainstream, as some of you have said.
One thing is clear, however: this Europe will only be a good Europe if it is a democratic one.
This is why it is important for the legislative package envisaged by the Commission to include targets relating to the elimination of these gender pay gaps, in order to encourage greater participation by women in the labour market.
There is a chemical called Roundup which can actually be sprayed on the banks of a river or a stream.
The purpose is identical: to raise the standard of living and improve the quality of life, ensure a high level of employment, improve social cohesion and combat exclusion.
However, this indicator is not holistic.
(DA) Madam President, we are here again today with something that has been pushed through by people who have not been elected, namely, the European Court of Justice, which, by means of a series of rulings, has put pressure on the genuinely elected institutions to also draw up this directive that has been voted through today.
For instance, the European Union has recently expressed its concerns regarding secret detention, and we hope that the President-elect will then address this issue and Member States will be able to answer.

Let me also assure you that I will share your conclusions with my colleagues in the Commission.

It is reflective of a deeper malaise for the people and Europe.
The cases of the South African Development Community (SADC) and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) are typical.
But, given that, as it now stands, companies can opt in or opt out, we would end up with 28 tax bases instead of the current 27, and that is hardly simplification.
My concern in relation to this issue is that the fear we had in the 1980s has been forgotten and, as a result, we are taking our eye off the situation, when there is a whole generation of people who did not grow up in the 1980s who need to hear the message again.
But sadly, CETA does come up with some other demands and political goals which we find deeply worrying.
We should endeavour to ensure that the programmes which are offered give the greatest possible support to the reforms being undertaken in these countries to bring them closer to the Union.
(DE) Mr President, we have numerous Erasmus programmes for students, young entrepreneurs and now for journalists.
Firstly, it is not a matter of lowering our sights merely to the creation of a transatlantic free trade area, but of making sure the development of our trade serves other more laudable objectives, which promote social and environmental standards.
Everyone essentially agrees to the principle of paying the true costs. Yet, when it comes to the specific measures to implement true costs, we hear a thousand excuses.
My group and I are, of course, happy with the compromise that has been negotiated by Dr Klinz and others.
Moreover, it is essential that the Commission makes its supervision of structural spending more effective, setting up suspension and adjustment procedures and developing a new Member State reporting system, bearing in mind that there are problems with 40% of the Commission audits.
I would like to ask the Commissioners what their response to this is.
Do not listen too much to the Member States; listen instead to the Spanish Presidency, because it has some good ideas on this subject.
We also said that we were in favour of a very close relationship between the central banks and the supervisory authorities.
The new President of Ukraine, on his first foreign visit since taking office, is coming to Brussels.
It appears that the European Solidarity Fund may be too restrictive to deal with this situation.
We need to consider how we can work together instead of imposing some form of harmonisation on the Member States from above.
I agree with him when he says that the fund as such cannot solve all of the problems straight away.
At the same time, we are also keen for the EU to pursue a responsible budgetary policy and therefore welcome the passages stating that we will also continue to identify and evaluate negative priorities.
Such management systems come under the jurisdiction of the Member States, and rightly so: they concern the history, society, economy, geography and hydrology of each country.
We must continue to work towards this goal by amending FP7.
For instance, there has been an exodus from some European Union countries of qualified, well-trained workers, in which Member States had made a significant investment.
(DE) Mr President, the climate conference in CancÃºn must exert positive pressure on our states in order to make progress in terms of international cooperation and national climate protection legislation.

Thus, we would contribute to the security of passengers who use airlines' services.
Therefore, this should be used as an opportunity for a radical overhaul of document access and publication procedures.
Is it a matter of learning to live with this state of affairs?
Lastly, we are delighted that the Committee on Budgets has endorsed the EURES first job initiative, since this is a real contribution by the European Parliament to the Youth on the Move flagship initiative, and it is also a tool to aid social innovation, which we need to develop.
Through his own drive and initiative he will certainly be able to launch or speed up many challenging projects.
We can only welcome the call made in the initiative for a code of procedure.
Yet again we have cause for concern about ethnic diversity in the Vojvodina region of Northern Serbia, since in many decisions the European Parliament has declared this to be a value to be protected.
This is another subject on which we await your proposals, Commissioner.
Madam President, I am pleased that you are in the chair for a second time for a debate on maritime policy.
However, we must, of course, ensure that it does not fall on deaf ears.
With its strong middle class, high level of education, closeness to Europe and overall moderation, Tunisia is well placed to take the leap towards democracy that people have now asked for with such force and courage, and I think everyone should agree that the European Union also has a strong interest in a democratic, prosperous and stable Tunisia.
Paramount in all of this, however, are the needs and safety of the children, many of whom are in great need.
I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Chastel, and the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, for their introduction to the discussion.
The other equally important matter was to find a balance between the main players operating in this sector, i.e. the interests of airports and airlines.
Are we to believe that this decision has nothing to do with the free trade agreement that has just been negotiated?
It is therefore necessary to adopt appropriate strategies as a precaution against such risks.
Madam President, I should like to say this to the Vice-President/High Representative: I appreciate very much what you said in your first speech on your policy and what you have been doing with North Africa - Egypt, Tunisia, Libya - and especially the focus you put on the young people and women there, and your approach to deep democracy that has to be rooted.
Interpretation of the Rules of Procedure : see Minutes
Mr Solana, we have heard very clearly that you are awaiting replies to the questions you put to Mr Jalili; Commissioner Ferrero has informed us of this, and we too are still waiting for replies to the questions we put to him.

(DE) Mr President, I wanted to direct a further question to Mr Verheugen.
The Treaty of Lisbon declares that we must have adequate social protection, that we must encourage people to stay in work, that we must eliminate poverty traps, etc., etc., etc., and yet we reduce the minimum wage by EUR 2 000 a year.
All countries must be treated equally.
Thank you, Commissioner, for your update.
As you know, the restructuring fund did not fulfil our expectations during the second year of the restructuring period, after actually quite a promising first year.
Mr President, it is now July, the month in which, even in spite of the crisis, many Europeans decide to spend their holidays on a cruise, or to travel by ship.
(PT) Mr President, the noticeably lower expectations that we saw before the CancÃºn conference should not justify excessively optimistic discussions with regard to its results, and it should be regarded as a success even less so.
I also consider it an urgent matter, of course, to improve the safety of humanitarian workers.
So we need to look at how we identify that form of trafficking.
The current agreement with Mauritania has been contributing to the economic development of Mauritania, where the fisheries sector is one of the fundamental pillars of the economy, representing almost 10% of gross domestic product (GDP), 29% of national budget revenue and almost 50% of exports.

The death penalty is a cruel and inhuman punishment.
The regulation establishes a common framework in relation to market surveillance.
This is severely affecting the poor, as well as producers of meat and milk.
Now let go of the reins on these joint technology initiatives (JTIs), where industry plays a 50% role, yet we carry on as if they were public sector organisations!
It represents lower costs for industry and, above all, for SMEs, which is essential.
Is it not the case that they are also allowed to say 'no'?
Madagascar is a country with which we work closely and intensively.
We are indeed aware of the problem to which you have been so kind as to draw my attention.
The problem is that this food security is a one-off measure, so we are helping at the time of crisis.
There are many problems with the current legal framework and the situation within Europe when it comes to patients' access to information about prescription-only medicines.
We know full well, however, that there are contradictions in this area too.
After the discussion in our group, and following your response, I will then present this decision in the second round.
However, the system cannot fail to be analysed across all of the many dimensions in which it may be applied.
The Commission and the Council must strongly and openly support civil society in Venezuela and must watch with great care the upcoming parliamentary elections.
Between 1997 and 2000, Commissioner, Romania 'exported' 9 150 children.
We are aware of imaging processes, for example, that will also play a major role in this regard in future.
In accordance with that declaration, the Union should express clear support for the movement in Korea which is working for the abolition of capital punishment.
Therefore, I would request that we vote on Amendment 80 as an addition to 37, if Members like it - which is a different matter - as it looks like we are also doing with Amendment 81.
I would like to explain my vote on the draft Council Regulation repealing a number of obsolete Council Acts relating to the Common Agricultural Policy.
I am glad that the European Parliament and Mr Ãzdemir have taken up precisely that question with this sound report.
I hope that one of the minor side-effects of this will be transparency.
These measures are already in place in some Member States.
I know you are new to the job, but do you believe that their standards, should they ever reach them, are equivalent to ours, given that they only require 90 days and 40 days?
A lot remains to be done, and it was very moving to see so many defenders of human rights here this morning.
The Commission is of the opinion that the compromise package tabled by your rapporteur, Mr Rapkay, is a very good result that can be fully supported.
Trade relations between the EU and India are significant, since the EU is India's principal trade partner and its biggest foreign investor.
Only for EU Member State Slovenia and candidate country Croatia has that not changed.
I think history will not forgive us for failing to act a second time.
There is a strong need to consolidate the experience of 'A to G' and involve industry, not by force, but by really involving them.
We do not want to conduct a debate here now.
This report will be useful only if it helps to increase the frequency, comparability and accuracy of these data at EU level.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FI) Mr President, tomorrow we shall adopt the EU's budget for next year, one in which payments clearly fall below the 1% ceiling, to say nothing of the fact that it will be 1.24% of GNI.
I have two points to make, first of all on the trajectory in terms of reductions, flexibility and penalties, which was particularly discussed during the trialogue at the weekend.
There is a real danger that pregnant workers or women who recently gave birth, who are in a more vulnerable position, will suffer discrimination in the current circumstances.
That is not the problem.

There should be only one seat for Europe in Mexico rather than the eight that were apparently needed in Copenhagen.
Now, with the current majorities in Congress, the law is not even on the table - with the result that we must assume that things will be more difficult unless we succeed in taking some of these matters further with countries such as China, India or Brazil.
The fight against terrorism (vote)
When drawing up my report, I had four objectives:
I therefore welcome the Youth on the Move initiative, in particular, its aspect of supporting and encouraging student mobility, and of recognising qualifications, as well as the importance ascribed to non-formal and informal education, which are often as important as formal learning or even more so.

I will be more than happy to report back to you after our next meeting on what we are planning.

A massacre is also happening in Iran, but it happens in slow motion.
We are waiting until we have a European prosecutor and then OLAF will no longer be what it is today.
Attention should be drawn to the fact that Eurostat will be granted the main supervisory and liability functions in these areas.

After all, it is possible to learn from the mistakes of the past, rather than repeating them.
I congratulate you on the balanced findings of the draft resolution.
Indeed, how can we advocate respect for the common interest, on the one hand, and call for shared public-private governance that does not hinder free competition, on the other?
For this - and I urge the President-in-Office, the Commissioner and Madam President to remember this - we need a tripartite declaration from all three institutions.
There are parts of the report of which we do not approve, for example the question of safe and secure parking areas for professional drivers, which we regard as a matter for the Member States.
I think that during all these years, the most important and most interesting thing he did was to have constantly persisted in saying the truth.
Forwarding of texts adopted during the sitting: see Minutes
In our opinion, however, the proposal for a regulation presented by the European Commission did not seem to us to offer due protection of confidentiality or to respect the various aspects entailed in the whole complex process of collecting such data.
We, on the other hand, thought that in the light of climate change it was necessary and that the Marine Strategy Directive should not therefore be laden with details which would render it impossible.
Protection of privacy must also apply to e-mail and other electronic correspondence and the basic principles of all our legislation, proportionality, necessity and non-discrimination, are emphasised.
A weak point of the Directive is the financing of measures to adjust to the objectives undertaken by the Member States until 2010, or 2015 respectively.
The Armenian lobby is so vociferous in this Parliament precisely because of the apparent conspiracy of silence that has surrounded the genocide question for almost a century.
The EU took an active approach in mobilising more resources from the international community to enable outstanding work at the Chernobyl site to be completed and we are continuing our efforts in this direction with our own contribution.
As regards the proposal for a single register, I do not think that there is any need for such a register with the Commission since the European Parliament and the Commission operate in completely different ways and, consequently, have different relationships with lobbyists.
There is a need to simplify the acquis communautaire by repealing those directives which contain provisions on means of measurement that are no longer used as a result of technical progress and the use of international standards.
The solutions introduced will help to improve the situation of patients in the European Union and will strengthen the common market, and so I voted in favour of adoption of the directive.

Mr President, I refer back to point 16 in the resolution where we say that 'Afghanistan's security problems are more complex than just a war on terror and that they therefore require more than a military solution'.
For the first time, with the introduction of Article 3a, the spouses are given an opportunity to designate the law applicable to the divorce proceedings by mutual agreement.

The country has also achieved good results in applying the developing EU acquis.
We need to find concrete answers and we also need to anticipate the consequences that this crisis will have on the financing of the economy, and on the economy itself.
Secondly, and this is particularly important for us: in future, we will have to have many common European agreements that apply to all 27 Member States and investors from these Member States if we are also to have a uniform level of protection within the European internal market.
That is the reason behind this solution, which I think makes a good deal of sense, namely to separate out the transport rules, which are easier to accept and, I hope, to implement.
Concerning Europol first of all, it would be difficult to stop Europol from becoming an agency.
Mr Costa has put an initial question: is the Commission satisfied with that situation and does it believe that the introduction of Regulation (EC) No 551/2004 on airspace organisation is progressing satisfactorily?
I am therefore very pleased to see the commitment shown by the UN Special Representative, Margot WallstrÃ¶m.
The European Parliament is therefore asking the European Commission to better coordinate the transferability of pensions at a European level.
Adjournment of the session
Firstly, we must do the job of regulating the financial sector properly.
Thank you.
Such awareness should increase our sense of responsibility, which should also extend to the Black Sea region.
Last week I called for a coordinated European response, because I am convinced that, without it, it will be much harder for Europe to overcome this crisis.
I would like to give you a couple of examples, particularly concerning Community law on the environment.
in writing. - (PT) I am happy to vote in favour of this amendment to the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) in order to extend the scope of its interventions in the housing sector so as to help marginalised communities in all the Member States.

We tabled some more detailed AM on the 'greening' of structural funds, rural development and agricultural policy which, unsurprisingly, were all rejected, but which can be reintroduced for the more detailed 1st budgetary reading of Parliament in September.

The European Union needs to intervene in the work of the UN Human Rights Council.
Yes, we must bring up the territorial autonomy of the SzÃ©kely people.

These factors are compounded by the inadequacy of the funds provided for the 2007-2013 period, particularly taking account of the enlargement of the EU, and the use of only 27.1% of available resources in the current period, as well as the continuation of national cofinancing and the administrative burden.
I would also like to thank the Chair, Mr Harbour, who, as has already been mentioned, has succeeded with great efficiency and by listening very carefully in setting nearly 11 parliamentary committees to work in a very short space of time.

The present initiative aims to extend the definition of 'public figure', as laid down in Article 2 of Council Decision 2002/956/JHA, in order to cover any person, regardless of whether or not they hold an official position, who is deemed to be under threat due to their contribution to or impact on the public debate.

Where the state has failed to provide education for poor children, parents themselves have come together, finance non-state education and, therefore, are also able to subsidise the non-working poor.
It is contrary to the Lisbon Strategy and undermines the fundamental rights and values of the Union.
My group will vote against this report because it disregards that important principle.
The people may only vote to support what the EU elite want.
16.

However, I also think that we must not demonise certain foods.

The point proposing a ban on smoking at work is incontrovertible.

Fourthly, it would be important that at any stage during new negotiations it is possible to raise issues that have yet to be addressed at the current stage and that these topics are approved by the Commission.
We need to reenergise the process and, in that way, remind our constituents that the EU does not just bring regulation and red tape at a huge cost, but should, and can actually bring tangible benefits for businesses and trade as well as consumers and individuals.
There has been great success in that very small-scale programme because it is working from the ground up.
You know what I am referring to: the very disgraceful bullying of Ireland.
That is why it seems appropriate to me that the compromise will be adopted only following the revision of the regulation by January 2013 and only following the feasibility study and reassessment of the objectives.
The current crisis is an acid test, and we must understand its full significance.
Without policy coherence - and that is not just any coherence, but it is policy coherence for development as it is stated in Article 208 of the Lisbon Treaty - we will not get anywhere.

That is the result of prosperity, and two thirds of people in the world still live in poverty.
The latest developments and the initiatives taken by the Commission on the specific issues of the environment-health relationship are very significant; they show that alongside the cooperation developing on a mid- to long-term basis between the environment, health and research sectors, it is possible to take immediate measures to further incorporate the health dimension into environment policy, with benefits to both the environment and health.
I would say in Mr Vondra's presence that we will naturally work closely with the Czech Presidency.
Besides, these two sections would sound the death knell for a large number of carriers of passengers by inland waterway, as they would be unable to afford the associated exorbitant insurance premiums, assuming anyone would insure them given a level of liability such as this.
As for the United Kingdom and the banks, people often say to me: 'Mr Brown has done more than you have'.
I would also thank the rapporteur for taking the trouble to find solutions to help us surmount certain problems that various Member States have owing to different judicial cultures.
We cannot therefore be content with a minimalist solution in line with the US proposal, which would generate a few billion euro - a relatively small revenue considering the huge costs.

Therefore, the report of Edite Estrela is really timely.
You need to structure and galvanise the process and provide sufficient coordinated information to the citizens of Europe.

Request for the waiver of Mr Elmar Brok's parliamentary immunity (
I spoke to him not long ago.
If Mercosur succeeds in achieving a deal with the EU, why should these countries continue to participate in WTO negotiations?
That, at least, would be money well spent.
In regions like Nordjylland that are particularly dependent on one sector, market recovery and the redeployment of workers in other areas of activity tend to be slower and more difficult.
Unfortunately, as the current debate has also shown, the beginnings of the Hungarian Presidency are turbulent.
The role of the European Parliament is undoubtedly, inter alia, to consider every case where there may be a violation of human rights, which may also result from membership of particular social groups.

Mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund: application EGF/2010/019 IE/Construction 41 from Ireland (
When the Commission states in its proposal that these payments may have to be graduated, that modulation into the second pillar must be introduced - as here the funds produce better results in terms of workers, the environment - then this is a foretaste of what lies ahead, namely the discussion following the publication of this information.
In relation to the progressive displacement of domestic production by more competitively priced imports from China, we can see negative social effects, which especially concern those regions that have for centuries specialised in the manufacture of clothes.

in writing. - The resolution focuses, in particular, on: (1) the regulatory environment, calling for better implementation of the SME test - in particular, in Member States - and for a reduction in bureaucracy and administrative burdens; (2) improving SMEs' access to finance through additional funding and instruments within the EIB (such as the RSFF and equity financing) and an enlarged (and independent) CIP; (3) improvements needed to ensure the participation of SMEs in public procurement; (4) simplification and better targeted R&D&I programmes to promote SMEs' innovation management capacity, access to R&D&I services and knowledge-based business services, through, for instance, technology transfer centres and universities; (5) the need for more attention to be paid to skills needed and other social and labour market issues affecting entrepreneurship and SMEs' capacities to fulfil their employment potential, in particular, managerial skills, digital skills and sustainability skills; (6) action to improve resource efficiency: sectoral SME projects to identify resource efficiency innovation in the value and supply chains; the adoption of an ambitious eco-innovation action plan and more funds for it through the CIP; more cost-effective energy efficiency measures to help SMEs reduce energy bills;
In my view, there are two main aspects that the review should focus on in particular: overcoming the problems related to the burden and complexity of administrative procedures, as a result of which those seeking European financing are diverted towards national financing.
Those affected by such a tragedy expect swift and efficient assistance, as well as good coordination of the measures taken.
Here I want to commend the Ombudsman on his new website.
I voted for the recommendation on the conditions for Swiss participation in the Youth in Action programme and in the Lifelong Learning programme because I consider it a positive factor in European youth strategy; this is because it is a stage in the cooperation process with this country on sectoral policies within the European Union.
Thousands of square kilometres of land are now free of landmines thanks to the work of people taking great risks in Bosnia, Angola and many other countries.
This is another point that needs to be made forcefully in the present debate.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, there is, however, something strange in all of this.
Madam President, Commissioner, at the start of our term of office we were all striving to increase funds for the implementation of EU tasks.
Most of the amendments dealt with horizontal issues, like the inclusion of gender and age in the breakdown variables and the use of additional and complementary financing provided by certain Community programmes in the two areas covered by the regulation.
Three months have already passed since the disaster in Japan, and we still do not know how all of the issues will be addressed.
I agree that in order to fully realise the EU 2020 flagship initiative 'An Agenda for new skills and jobs', the EU institutions should embark on a more pragmatic, comprehensive and wide-ranging initiative supported by all Member States which should focus on connecting the areas of vocational education, professional qualifications, lifelong learning, apprenticeships and the labour market.
Furthermore, a good deal of confusion persists about the guarantee of Internet neutrality and the safeguarding of users' fundamental rights.
Europe's new strategy must be based on a redefinition of the resources available for the Mediterranean, provide for an increase in financial commitments to facilitate political, economic and social reform in the countries of the region, and press for resources relating to immigration.
Given that the US is committed to this approach for all their FTAs, Europe must achieve similarly strict enforcement measures.
This provides countries with the information and the means to stop unwanted imports of toxic chemicals, putting the requirement and onus on the exporter/exporting country to comply with the laws of the importing country.

Indeed, innovation is an integral part of both the Commission's climate change package and the plan for revitalising the European economy.
Unfortunately the negotiations that will now be entered into with the Council are not likely to correct our aim, in an EU in which the good of the Union as a whole is rarely able to withstand national egotism.
I am thinking about pay: it is, at last, expressly stated that remuneration cannot be lower than that which the law recognises for all other European citizens.
This new regulation proposes that we harmonise these rules of conflict of laws.
The report's obsession with climate change could lead to accepting advice that obliges arable farmers to pump tractor exhaust under the ground, increasing fuel consumption and spoiling seabeds as a consequence.
I think this will be the key element in future negotiations.
As is well known, the United States and Russia are developing a new alternative to the Convention: controlled and self-destructing mines.
A day will come when the peoples of Asia, of the Americas and of Africa will get together.
On the first point, in particular that of giving Member States more responsibility, I would also like to draw attention to the fact that the lack of harmonisation between national systems creates significant differences in terms of the amount of time needed to verify cases of fraud and irregularity.
But the increase in demand for wilderness tourism puts pressure on the very same values that the tourists are seeking and can speed up the destruction of fragile ecosystems.
It is rooted in the social and environmental spheres.
Although it is important for achieving the goals of this strategy, cohesion and regional policy should be independent and provide a framework for establishing strong synergies between all European policies.
On the one hand, I recall that in the last 14 or 15 years, this has not been the case, since the European Court of Auditors did not feel able to approve the execution of the annual budgets.
The professions in question can be perfectly well filled by our own workers.
The conclusion of bilateral fisheries agreements between the European Community and non-member countries, termed 'Fisheries Partnership Agreements' (FPA), has been standard practice under the common fisheries policy (CFP) and is central to the policy's external dimension.
The results of the study should be available in the third quarter of 2009.
The Taiwanese Government under President Ma responded promptly by deploying soldiers to the worst-affected communities and areas, and requesting assistance from the international community.
Therefore, it is imperative to invest in internal staff training and lifelong learning.
I think the oral question is very clear.
It is, however, unacceptable to use this cause in order to force the introduction of fundamental and non-negotiable human values, as is the case with the right to life.
We need simple and clear rules, consistently and rigorously applied'.
In recent years, we have seen those forces working together with very good results.
There is a constant increase in demand for the development of services linked to modern technology and for high-quality services meeting the standards and expectations of their users.
I would like to inform you that Written Declaration 0054/2009 by Mrs Lynne, Mrs JÄdrzejewska and Mr Schlyter on the transportation of horses for slaughter in the European Union was signed today, 24 February 2010, by a majority of Parliament's component Members. Therefore, in accordance with Rule 124(4) of the Rules of Procedure, it will be forwarded to its addressees and published with the names of its signatories in the Texts Adopted of the sitting of 25 February 2010.
The costs resulting from urban traffic congestion are rising to approximately 1% of European GDP.
The European Union can be competitive only insofar as internal policies bolster its capacity to respond to today's challenges.
They discourage individual initiatives in favour of competition among dealers and repairers and encourage the development of the sector.
That is why we have digital tachographs that automatically record driving hours, and the authorities monitor compliance with this.
The Commission promotes policies to combat the exclusion of vulnerable groups, and this therefore includes, in particular, people in custody.
In reality, there was no need to clarify this because in various judgments involving France, the United Kingdom and Poland, the European Court of Human Rights had already ruled that in the areas of life, the value of life, respect for life and the family, it must be left up to the Member States to decide according to their history, tradition and culture.
We have a year of tough negotiations ahead of us.
An innovation policy that is consistent and integrated, and has a long-term vision will enable us to leverage strengths and resolve weaknesses detected at regional level.
At present, the US has not made a formal request.
Today, on that anniversary, we are debating a new war which has broken out, but this new war was one which we - the European Union - have been able to stop very quickly.
There is no doubt that violence against women violates their basic rights and fundamental freedoms, in particular the right to security and human dignity.
In particular, it was successive presidencies, and principally the Czech Presidency and the current Swedish Presidency, as they were responsible for the second and third readings.
The line taken by Parliament, as indicated by rapporteur JÄdrzejewska, is very clear.
Ladies and gentlemen, today I have tried to outline some of the challenges we face in the future.
The Commission clearly recognises the importance that bees play in the EU's ecology and its ecosystem.
We firmly believe that we can make much better use of the cooperation between entrepreneurs in the cultural sector, on the one hand, and academia, both higher education - universities and higher education colleges - and secondary education, on the other, and that they offer a lot more opportunities than we are currently utilising.
(NL) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I share the great concern of many in this House about the fate of Opel and the people who work there or make a living in that area.
Although the mission sent to observe the 2006 Palestinian elections recognised the legitimacy of their result, the European Union and its Member States chose to boycott the elected government, just as they boycotted the government of national unity formed thereafter to break that deadlock.
Nor shall we let anyone, whether inside or outside the European Union, set limits on our resolute defence of human rights.
I say will punish, using the future, as unfortunately, and this is an appeal to your sensibility, between April and now the reservations of the national parliaments of some Member States have not been withdrawn with the result that the procedure leading to the entry into force of this European law to punish racism and xenophobia has been blocked.
Unfortunately, it is not very satisfactory because, at a time when we are witnessing several Member States pursuing a rash immigration policy that grants large numbers of foreigners lawful residence in the EU, and when the lack of border control allows people to move freely across borders, there is a need for stronger border control between the EU's Member States on a permanent basis.
Please look at it again.
(DE) Mr President, the United States and Europe are the West's companions in fate.
Perhaps it comes down to whether one regards the glass as half-full or half-empty.
I strongly condemn this gang rape, as well as other human rights violations, and I welcome the request made to the United Nations and the DRC Government that it undertake an impartial and thorough investigation of all incidents, and guarantee that those responsible for violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law be held to account for their actions and prosecuted under the terms of international law.
Agenda for next sitting: see Minutes
I would be grateful if Parliament's Bureau could advise on the necessary measures.
These people come because we need them.
This is something where the Commission can really ask for an improvement when it comes to European statistics.
Some of what has been said today in this House should be put into perspective by viewing it in the light of history.
I want to see an EU with a humane asylum and immigration policy that protects immigrants and their rights.
Given that we have managed to discuss the problems we are facing within the European Union in a vote that divided this House and split it in two, and which has given us a lot of work over the past two months, we can now confront President Lukashenko of Belarus with our heads held high.
A Member noted that we have time constraints, but let me point out that the first proposal - the general animal health law - that will come into force is scheduled for 2010, not 2013 as was mentioned.
The countries of the European Union are experiencing the crisis now; Europe needs new jobs now; support for new entrepreneurship initiatives is needed right away.
Now you are going to force European workers to compete not only against each other, but against immigrant workers, too.
It would be good if we could identify the opportunities inherent in this problem; if we could shift our perception of the Roma issue from problem to opportunity.
President of the Commission. - Mr Zahradil, first of all, unfortunately, the economic problems that we have in Europe are not only in the euro area.

The original European Commission proposal that this directive would apply to all airports with passenger numbers greater than one million per annum was extremely worrying, particularly from an Irish viewpoint, because, if this approach had been adopted, then the directive would have applied to both Shannon and Cork airports, and possibly, in due course, to Ireland West Airport as it seeks to continue its expansion operations.
- Madam President, I do not hold with the notion that our economic salvation lies in tiny value added tax cuts, which are something we have had in the United Kingdom with, frankly, only a marginal positive impact.

Therefore, in view of the scale of these challenges, in view of this totally unacceptable situation, the Council has taken the decision to accelerate and strengthen its action.
Before we talk about the implementation of Europe 2020, we urgently need to put the strategy on hold and give ourselves more time for the decision-making process and we need to carry out an analysis of the actual challenges we face.

Cutting down on red tape and thereby streamlining tendering procedures would allow researchers to focus on their own professional goals, through the use of resources and skills that would otherwise be wasted.

In other words, the euro zone has indeed equipped itself with the means to decide democratically on its exchange policy.

(PL) Mr President, the European Union has an ageing population and the percentage of people suffering from age-related diseases is rising.
Today, despite the Goma Conference on peace, stability and development and the conclusion of a ceasefire agreement in January 2008, violent fighting continues to take place in the east of the DRC, leading to the worst possible atrocities being committed against the civilian populations, in particular, women, children and the elderly.

In the Democratic Republic of Congo the passage of the armies is accompanied by all possible kinds of crime against the civilian population, such as rape, murder and pillage.
With the end of milk quotas, the end of a proper agricultural budget as part of the 2014-2019 financial framework, and the retirement of the majority of producers, not to be replaced, the end of the great CAP was planned for 2013 - it was as simple as that.
The errors observed by the Court of Auditors are not a result of attempts to defraud on the part of the project promoters, but a result of the complexity of the conditions for eligibility.
The next item is voting time.

I think an apology is warranted from Mr Schulz.
That is in progress at the moment, of course, but are the traditional minorities also included in this?
In relation to crisis management tools, if the EP improves the situation with respect to the Commission's initial proposal, I can only regret that crisis distillation - which, if compulsory, would not create the excesses we are seeing now - is no longer an option among the possible instruments for handling temporary crises.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (CS) Madam President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to thank Mrs Elizabeth Lynne for the very good report and for her excellent cooperation.
(Applause)
That is why it is very important that he or she is present not only at the European but at the national level as well, especially in countries where democratic principles and supervision are still in the process of being built and where government structures cannot provide effective remedy for their citizens at the national level, yet those citizens are also citizens of the European Union.
Parliament is the conscience of Europe and this conscience must not be silenced by any pronouncements by any minister holding office in the European Union.

Article 5 of the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic could not be clearer.

We have heard today, in the Enlarged Bureau, from the Polish Foreign Minister, the next President-in-Office of the Council, and his initiative to establish a Polish foundation on the subject of democracy and human rights.
If European products are to be competitive in global markets, we cannot afford experiments that may result in even further damage to an already weak European economy by imposing yet more additional costs.

However, in the course of 20 years, the context of these negotiations has changed profoundly.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has discussed and approved its report in a short space of time so as to allow today's vote here to take place, and so that the next step towards the agreement with the Council can be taken as soon as possible and thus allow the new provisions of this directive to enter into force.

To this end, a more sufficient funding system must be made available to poorer nations.
The agricultural markets, too, need budgetary and general policy frameworks and rules.

We are really raising capitalism's moral standards.
I voted in favour of this document, because the early years of childhood (pre-school) are critical for cognitive, sensory and motor development and language acquisition, and also lay the foundations for lifelong learning.

This cooperation should take place before, during and after the deployment of observers, because a high quality mission is one that is well prepared, operates effectively on the ground and is properly monitored.

If the outside world and non-specialists in this area are also to understand what this is all about, since this is a very technically complex subject matter that nevertheless concerns a democratic institution and serves to eliminate the so-called democratic deficit in Europe, we should point out the following: What this means is that Parliament and the Council, the two legislative powers of the European Union, cannot on their own deal with every matter of detail.
I am glad that there were no proposals for the introduction of legislative measures in the area of energy poverty.
In the same way it favours extensive production to the detriment of labour-intensive production.
President Obama is currently attempting - I wish him well - to introduce a national health care system, which we have practically everywhere in Europe, with some differences.

The role and future of macro-regional strategies may be related to the debate over the future use of European funds, although in our view, it is unnecessary for today's debate to extend into a discussion on the future architecture of the cohesion policy and the anticipation of potential financial allocations designated for individual states in the coming financial perspective.
Against this backdrop, we must ask ourselves two questions.
Thank you again for the high quality of the debate.

Also, reducing the speed limit will allow us to fight the greenhouse effect.
How can we reinforce controls?
In an effort to see this great institutional theatre of Europe also become the cradle of such diversities and such autonomous identities as those which I hope for in the Europe of the regions that we shall learn to celebrate in the future, I therefore call, Mr President, for more and more people to come to prominence through the use of our languages, too.
I call on the Commission to be strong and committed towards an agreement based on the European Parliament resolution and the 12 conditions you mentioned before, bearing in mind that without complete agreement from both sides, Albania's European integration process might be completely frozen.

The financial and economic crisis, combined with demographic changes, has had an impact on pension systems.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, the sooner we are ready, the better it will be for European citizens.
Therefore it was all the more incomprehensible to us all when the rapporteur in the Committee on Budgetary Control did not want to grant discharge for three of the four agencies, for the most incredible reasons - particularly as, even if they were valid, the agencies themselves were not responsible for those points, for example staff regulations relating to temporary staff of the institution, or the location of the head office of the relevant agency, or even the way the principle of subsidiarity was observed.
Mr Verhofstadt has provided the correct justification for this.
Where Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev are concerned, I would state that these individuals must at last be freed - otherwise the state visit by the Russian President to the European Parliament will take place under a huge cloud.

Across the EU, there are still too many barriers to trade in the construction sector, resulting in the Member States' justification of the technical rules put in place to limit the free movement of goods and services.

The trouble is that these organisations lack democratic legitimacy, and that is very dangerous.
If we can ensure that the cooperation is friendly, but also serious, and if we do not forget to make legitimate demands and highlight legitimate failings, we will be making a step in the right direction, not only in terms of the cooperation between Europe and Russia, but, most importantly, in terms of human rights.
It was recognised then, and recognised now, that these laws lead to censorship and the promotion of discrimination and homophobia: discrimination and homophobia which destroys people's lives and blights the souls of those who practise it.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of information about prescription-only medicinal products is a sensitive subject because it has an important effect on the protection of the right to health and welfare of all citizens.
It also condemns the use of brutal force by the police and KGB services against the protesters on election day and, in particular, expresses its indignation over a brutal attack on Uladzimir Niakliayeu - examples of the severe violation of basic democratic principles such as freedom of assembly and freedom of expression, as well as of human rights, and it expresses its concern at the attempts by the Belarusian authorities to take into state custody Danil Sannikov, three-year-old son of presidential candidate, Andrei Sannikov, and investigative journalist, Irina Khalip, both of whom have been jailed since the 19 December election.

If you could have heard what the President of the World Bank said, if you could have heard some of the leaders of African countries and other countries represented in enlarged meetings talk about the hunger and starvation that now represent a real threat to so many people in the world, you would understand to what extent European aid is necessary and indispensable.
The reality, in any case - and you know this better than I do - is that the US Government is currently negotiating with the South Koreans about making adaptations to a similar agreement that they have.

I think that EURES could be used not only in order to inform and improve the security for those who would like to move to another country and another labour market, as Mr Andersson pointed out here earlier today, but it could also be used in order to inform all the decision-making institutions of the remaining obstacles we have in the European labour markets because the gap between vision and theory on the one hand and the reality is quite big.

The time has come for us to switch our attention from large enterprises, which are loud, I should not like to say - like children - but they are loud, and pay attention to the quieter ones, most of whom work after all with the small ones.

Have they been devised in support of European businesses?

Commissioner Oettinger, I believe you are taking initiatives - and that is something you must indeed do - to talk to Libya in particular, but also to others, concerning our standards and our approaches.

(ES) Madam President, Mr Saryusz-Wolski should be congratulated because his report clearly states the essential points that the Union should take into account in order to establish a genuine common foreign policy on energy: reciprocity with exporting countries, the need to better coordinate our energy diplomacy at European level, and the importance of establishing an integrated and competitive market.
It is high time to apply an objective method to the assessment of totalitarian crimes. We can make use of the experience of the European Court of Human Rights.

on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking both rapporteurs for the magnificent piece of work they have carried out in preparing this document.
Such accusations are an affront to the principles of friendly international relations, as well as simple human decency.

The crisis caused by the irresponsibility of the markets and the banks, and this huge amount of aid, are directly responsible for the increase in the public deficits and the public debt that these same markets are today trying to penalise.
I have discovered that cooperation between the various IMPEL inspection services consists not only of the sharing of experience, but also, and perhaps even most importantly, of joint monitoring operations and exchange of information about environmental crimes and offences.

In addition, several delegations from our committee visited the agencies to satisfy themselves as to the activities on the ground.
It has been added to the conclusions of various Council formations and recommendations that Member States should be encouraged to take particular consideration of the fact that the most vulnerable groups are always those who suffer most, so I do agree with that.

The report evaluates the financing instrument for development cooperation (DCI), four years after the regulation that implemented it came into force.
(SK) Mr President, experience from previous years, when the breakdown in gas supplies from Ukraine and widespread electricity blackouts in a number of EU countries proved that our energy system lacks the reserves necessary to deal with crisis situations, has shown us that any solution will require extensive investment.
That is important to ensure food security and avoid price volatility.
That is why I support the call for no political refugees such as the ones in Iraq mentioned earlier to be returned to Iran, especially no minors, because they would simply be slaughtered without trial.

It would seem that my colleagues agree with the oral amendment.

Globalisation and emigration are contributing to the broad palette of languages used by Europeans every day.
This we can say straight away.
This tax is contrary to the internal market.

In the version amended by Parliament and the Council, the sale of paint strippers containing dichloromethane to consumers will be banned completely.
Something that politicians hoped would encourage continued development and give consumers much needed guidance has instead helped to stem the development of better products and made it more difficult for consumers to make the right choices.
We must really limit exceptions to structurally weak regions and define them for very tightly limited production quantities.
Now we will not even achieve 20%.
Overall, our relations have improved over the last two years.
(DE) Mr President, with regard to the disaster of the budget negotiations for 2011, I would like to say: firstly, the right to draw up a budget is a central right of any democratic parliament. Secondly, a parliament that takes itself seriously must exercise this right.
I would like to highlight the fact that the changes do not just concern the influence of individual states on EU processes, but also the fundamental principles themselves, on which the EU was established 50 years ago.
Those pushing the unscientific nonsense of man-made climate change - Shell, Monsanto, the international banks, Bilderberg one-worlders, carbon billionaires and their useful idiot allies on the left - are running the biggest fraud in human history.
We believe we have to take practical steps: a comprehensive test ban treaty should come into force; the fissile material cut-off; support for peaceful uses of nuclear energy to find safe ways of making sure that we avoid proliferation - for example, the contributions we make to the nuclear fuel bank - and support for a very strong and effective IAEA.
That must not happen.
Anyone who deplores the lack of or insufficient European culture in the world, which they have every reason to do, can only welcome the MEDIA Mundus programme and vote in favour of it enthusiastically.
World Bank researchers predict that, in 2010 alone, 64 million more people will be plunged into extreme poverty by the crisis and that because of it, in 2009, between 30 000 and 50 000 children have already died in Africa of malnutrition.
We very much agree with the concept mentioned in the report, regarding the universality, indivisibility and interdependence of human rights.

We cannot 'half-commit' to investment in renewable energy sources and low-carbon transport.
In the jungle, when I knew that, it made all the difference to me.
Moreover, we welcome the increase in lending volume to SMEs and we agree with your call for more qualitative measures to increase the value added and transparency of the EIB Group intervention in this domain.
That said, we still have a long way to go before road freight transport bears a reasonable proportion of the costs it represents for our societies: wear and tear of infrastructure, pollution, public health and accidents.
I do not see any examination of how we can change the ways that we involve the regions and create networks, whether or not these are EU dominated in attitude.
This vote is an excellent outcome for many reasons.
I think there are a number of important points in this resolution.
What a right to abortion has to do with combating barbaric genital mutilation will remain a mystery to me.
Finally, I would like to say that we welcome this agreement, because, as I have already said, 27 agreements are ultimately being replaced by one.
No doubt the concentration of the chemicals in these products has increased but for consumers, this is compatible with the present GHS solution because we know that people use these products every day, so we did not need to overclassify them.
I would say yes, but mostly perhaps in the sense that people realised in the last 24 hours that if they did not show the will to compromise, there would be a real risk of not getting anything done, and the whole process would risk dying.
This proposal on the single permit act is very important, and therefore we hope to come to an agreement very soon.

Why?
We could not vote for resolutions that purported to give the European Union the power to conduct foreign policy or that were inconsistent with our policy of neutrality on the conflict.
The criminalisation of expressions of opinion in Belgium, for instance, goes much further than in countries like Italy and the United Kingdom, where freedom of expression is actually respected.

I sincerely hope that we will see good will prevail for the sake of good neighbourly relations.
The European Union is ahead of the curve, and we will contribute to bringing about further consistency at global level.

In the last two years, we have witnessed around 100 prison sentences and other punishments meted out to people who have signed the movement's petition.
The introduction of strict sanctions might, through its impact, create a barrier and isolate this country even more.
This applies to Macedonia, but also just as much to Croatia, Serbia, Turkey, Kosovo and Iceland.
Mr President, the House will understand that our group, too, has held a detailed discussion on the situation that has now arisen with regard to Kosovo.
We believe that the directive must explicitly recognise the importance of airports to the social and economic development of these regions and to territorial cohesion.
I do not think this is adequate.
In Lisbon, Secretary-General Rasmussen received a similar mandate to work with me on reinforcing EU-NATO relations.
I therefore approve of Parliament's requirement that women's rights be explicitly addressed in all human rights dialogues and, in particular, the combating and elimination of all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls, all forms of harmful traditional or customary practices, for example, female genital mutilation and early or forced marriage, all forms of trafficking in human beings, domestic violence and femicide, exploitation at work and economic exploitation.
I voted against this report.
In my view, however, the big news of the day is not this agreement.
It is a pleasure for me to inform you that Hungary, too, will become part of this programme next year and is prepared to participate in the resettlement programme.
Another waste of money: how many billions is this House of History going to cost, to sell propaganda and tell how the European Union 'saved the world'?
13.

This has programmes across the globe, and one of them is now going to be part-funded by the European Union budget.
The fact that today's result is significantly better - and I would like to thank specifically Mrs Gurmai, Mrs Wallis, Mr Lamassoure and Mr HÃ¤fner for working closely together and making such good progress on refining this regulation - is also due to the many members of civil society who have subjected our considerations and our debates to repeated reality and practicability checks.
Unfortunately, Russia has not taken a single step forward towards establishing democracy and respect for human rights, which does not augur well for future negotiations and cooperation.
The debate is closed.
We shall still be able to draw up a resolution on the results after the summit, but this Parliament, which wants to be political, should also adopt political freedom of expression by a majority before the summit in order to show mainland Russia what we think about freedom and democracy here in the European Parliament.
As the European Parliament, we should, indeed, look at what the Commission is saying today.
For this reason I would again like to thank the chairman of the transport committee, and Parliament as a whole.
I hope that this attack will not deter India, an important ally in the reconstruction of Afghanistan, from continuing its assistance.
I thank the Union and Member States which are helping us carry out permanent reforms to the justice system and implement anti-corruption measures because this is also what Romanian citizens want.
However, in the report it is claimed that the EU has addressed the potentially trade-distorting elements of EU agricultural policy that can negatively impact on farmers in the developing world.
Please give us an alternative so that we have something on the table and can discuss, otherwise I am afraid deforestation will continue and so will biodiversity loss.

Trying at all costs to speed up enlargement, including economically weak and politically unstable countries, certainly has not helped the consolidation of the European project.
First of all, it is true that there is no scientific evidence that GMOs pose a hazard to human or animal health.

The Commission will discuss this issue next week and we will come up with a concrete proposal on this issue according to the Rules of Procedure.
The requirement to indicate the origin of products may contribute to the equalisation of conditions on the world trade market, because similar protection for domestic products is also insisted on by various global economies, such as the United States, Canada or Japan.
You have to be in the position of needing a visa to go to the United States to appreciate just how important its removal is.
The report does not succeed in taking real account of the various conditions prevailing in individual EU Member States and, consequently, does not succeed in making provision for the necessary, duly adjusted policies.

On the other hand, the general public does not feel it is properly informed of the causes and the consequences of nosocomial infections.
I should also like to reiterate the firm intention of the Commission to continue its efforts on the Environment and Health Action Plan.
I support Ms Lulling's recommendations that the national systems should recognise the importance of protecting self-employed workers, and we should stand against all forms of discrimination, but I am still not convinced that this House is best placed to work on employment matters.
In comparison to this kind of ambitious scenario that we would like to see, the insistence of Parliament on a strong chapter in the FTA on sustainable development is absolutely the minimum we need in terms of deciding whether or not this House can give its assent to the upcoming agreement.
Europe should not allow this.
One of the first ways to solve the problem can be implemented in schools.
Strengthening social cohesion and eradicating poverty and social exclusion must be political priorities for the European Union and its Member States.
We have already discussed the fact that in India last year there were five million more people with a new diet that is based much more on milk, milk products and meat.
It is as though they have been overlooked, wiped out, which is not good.
It is now for the Commission to size up this call.
We need Russia if we are to be able to deal with the global challenges effectively.
Yes, this is how it really is.
Mr President, as far as the Treaty is concerned, the devil is not in the detail, he is in the ratification.
That is not a simple question to answer, but I consider the subsidiarity aspect to our proposal to be in keeping with today's aviation security arrangements.
I believe that in 2010, particular attention should be focused on programmes for training young entrepreneurs and for supporting them in setting up their own companies.
This is undermined if exchange of information between authorities is restricted.
It calls for a public debate about urban planning in Spain, which will allow legislative measures to be adopted against speculation and unsustainable development, and will put an end to Ã  la carte legislation practised in autonomous regions such as AragÃ³n and Valencia.
I think we need to ensure multi-disciplinary teaching programmes and insist on cooperation and partnership not only between educational institutions, students and professionals in the cultural and creative sector, but also between businesses of all sizes, between the public and the private sector, and between craftspeople and financial institutions.
Through the negotiations we had many discussions with NGOs and industry and came up with a proposal which is excellent.

Madam President, cutting the fins off sharks is barbaric.
Unfortunately the world is awash with lost opportunities, with shipwrecked good ideas.
She is willing to send her underlings, but she is not willing to have a democratic cross-examination by this House.
I voted for this report because we must debate the measures adopted at European and national level on social and territorial cohesion which aim to fulfil the objectives of EU policies, including that of increasing global economic competitiveness.
Today's vote, which confirmed the release of EUR 35.6 million for these departments, as well as EUR 31.2 million for Portugal, which suffered flooding in Madeira caused by this storm, is an example of this common desire to show true solidarity between European citizens.
I am sure that those on the other side of the Atlantic are concerned as well, so that is why I think we should work together on increasing cyber security, always respecting the fundamental freedoms - because freedom of expression is a sacred right for us in the European Union - while being clear that data protection and privacy are also fundamental rights.
It is then in the hands of Parliament and the Council to see whether it is possible to spend some of this money.
The report by Mrs Frassoni is aimed at strengthening what I would call the backbone of the Commission, so that the Commission is aware of the importance of this task, and so that, even if we want a prior phase of negotiation with governments on the difficulties that may arise, at the moment of truth the Commission acts as the citizens expect, with strength and vigour, and applying Community law.
(NL) Today, we are discussing Europe's economy from a long-term perspective, and how to achieve sustainable economic growth.

The airline Wizzair refused to allow the dog on board, even though their regulations state that it is possible to transport guide dogs belonging to blind or deaf persons, and the online purchase of the ticket also included the dog.

I believe that interinstitutional cooperation should be improved as regards translation, interpretation, recruitment (EPSO) and EMAS and should be extended to other areas.
In this chamber, in front of MEPs who today represent the democratic governments of Europe, democratic parties and democratic sentiments, I have heard people say: 'You know, we have stepped in to solve the problem where Mr Ahtisaari failed.'
It shows gross contempt for the verdict of the peoples of France, the Netherlands and Ireland, and for the obvious inclinations of all the other European peoples, who are not moved by the policies, institutions, values, visions and symbols of the European plutocracy so typical of the anti-popular character of the EU.
The foundations of a strong Union and a successful future are built on trust and mutual accommodation, just like in a family.
We would emphasise that there is also a need for consistency in this area between other EU policies and the objectives of this Regulation.
It is necessary to adopt several key measures.
There is still work to be done.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Dirk Sterckx, for his efforts on the directive on reporting formalities for ships arriving in, or departing from, ports.
Administrative cooperation is a way to supplement national legislations, but we need to remember that it will never replace them or result in their approximation.
The report also proposes acknowledging the stepping up of the European fight against piracy and supporting the growing effectiveness of Operation Atalanta, as well as the need to improve the quality of ship design in order to adapt them to the highest accessibility and safety standards.
In Belarus, elections are not free, there is no freedom of expression, association or demonstration, and repression by the authorities is increasing.
This is why, after this directive, we are asking for and anticipating from the Commission that the next step will be to extend protection to victims in this common area of justice and security.
The next item is the short presentation of the report by Hella Ranner, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on penalties for serious infringements against the social rules in road transport.
Mr President, yes I agree, it is very important that we have independent economic impact assessments of EU regulations.
If the European Union is to be truly democratic and close to its citizens, close cooperation is required at local, regional and national level between the Union's institutions and its Member States on the one hand and civil society on the other.
More than anything else, early intervention is crucial.
(PL) Madam President, democracy in Europe is based on providing effective protection for fundamental rights and ensuring that they are promoted.
The competition for using agricultural land also contributes to the increase in the prices of food products and, in 2007, the area designed for biofuel cultures increased by 13.6% as compared to 2006, and by 31.5% as compared to 2002-2006.
Mr President, good afternoon to you all.
On that occasion, President Yusuf made a strong appeal for international assistance to support a better, secure environment for people living in Somalia.
I cannot reply within one minute to all the comments that I have heard, but I would like to say, with regard to Russia, that as Mr Severin knows, the report recommends constructive cooperation, but naturally without prejudice to human rights and international law.

The European Union should stop exposing itself voluntarily to the problems of US financial policy.
I agree with Parliament that the importance of our ports is linked not only to economic factors but also to the role of ports in society.
We believe that this is another important decision that the Council must take.
Here I would say that postponing the execution of such a decision would greatly undermine and possibly negate the purpose of the proposed legislation.
Indeed, this is also why Parliament is insisting on our introducing a separate budget line for the 'Small Business Act' and, in particular, a budget line for climate change.

Equally, we need - and this is also the appeal we have made to the Commission - a strategy which allows us to conserve the rich ecosystems in our natural parks, be it the Bauges, ArdÃ¨che or LubÃ©ron, with the whole undertaking relying on funding designed for preventive measures and actions to re-establish the damaged ecosystem.
(DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I assume that today we are holding a debate on policy strategy for the last time in this form because we are to have a new model in the Treaty of Lisbon.
In fact, at the first reading of this report when it was adopted by Parliament with a large majority, it was stressed that we need to launch a broad debate on the labelling of textile products, including the issue of origin marking and we proposed to extend the scope of the regulation to certain sectors.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposals by Mr Grosch are aimed at the uniform and stringent application of road transport regulations, which I support; I agree that criteria ought to be laid down which should have to be met before these activities can be carried out, and that surveillance by the relevant authorities should be stepped up through a single document recognition system and a system of sanctions, and that permission must be sought from the countries that these services cross.
I believe that the people who have been affected appreciate the solidarity shown by the European institutions and by you in person, with the condolences expressed and the minute of silence, and they will also appreciate any financial and legislative support for reconstruction.

To close - and I am sorry that I do not have more time to reply to the very specific issues raised - I should just like to say before I forget, because a number of speakers referred to the economic recovery programmes, that they are indeed a very good idea, because there are numerous benefits from including projects to prevent disasters which we can more or less expect to happen next year as well - as previously said, we discuss these matters every year - both because they will generate economic activity and create more jobs and because they will prevent damage costing millions of euros in restoration works.
In other respects, we should praise Egypt very much for its important role in the last weeks and days for its efforts and hard work on achieving a ceasefire and maybe even an armistice with, at the very end of the process, peace in the region.
There was some justification for the inequalities under the production subsidies system, which favoured farmers who produced more.

Restating their validity is not enough.
It is like 1989 and the European Union needs special procedures - this House, the Commission, the Council, the EAS - and we welcome Cathy Ashton's down payment for democracy, but we need to do more.

(DE) Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, human rights, liberty and equality are far too important for all of us to allow games to be played with them, for them to be put in the balance against powerful interests, and for commercial interests perhaps to take precedence over these values that are so important.

This extra cost represents roughly the coverage of expenditures for one quarter, while we have seen that the setting up of the service is still at the 10% level.

I am also delighted that, on this very day, the relevant regulation has been signed guaranteeing a practical start-up of the EGNOS and Galileo programmes.

However, we have reservations about certain aspects of the proposal where the rapporteur seems to have lost a sense of proportion.
Ladies and gentlemen, I cannot say more on this subject here, but certainly as far as the conflicts are concerned, we intend to bring them up for discussion and we should definitely discuss them.
If there are any doubts about this, take a look at the Franco-German project on the so-called Pact for Competitiveness, which aims to raise the retirement age, put collective bargaining at risk, and deliver yet another blow to labour and social rights, all so as to ensure increased earnings for economic and financial interest groups.
In particular, we should support the solutions contained in the draft directive concerning equal treatment of temporary workers and other workers regarding status and safety, together with respect for the social standards required of enterprises in the area of equal treatment, in terms of remuneration and working conditions for temporary workers and other employees.
Moreover, we want to develop an advanced environmental policy while, at the same time, guaranteeing the competitiveness of our businesses.
I am confident that Baroness Ashton will make a selection that will truly represent not only all 27 Member States of the EU, but will, first and foremost, represent the EU as our shared project.
It is therefore important for the Commission to make it clear that the principle of equal pay for equal work must apply and that we must have good social conditions throughout Europe, so that the tide of protectionism does not advance across the EU.
We saw what happened on the Hudson River last winter: had there not been a pilot, there would have no doubt been no mechanism that could have straightened up the plane.
I read into all that was said, about the different people and the different countries, the fundamental point about human rights, which is this: for them to apply to you, you simply need to be human and here.

The Council and Member States have to support together the European and national commitment to deepening and strengthening the Single Market.
In the words of a compatriot of the Commissioner, Mr Tajani, the chairman, Mr Costa, and Antonio Gramsci, in these discussions we are seeking to balance the pessimism of our intelligence with the optimism of our will.
The debate is closed.
One important aspect relates to the deregulation of services, especially with regard to modes 3 and 4.

We must emphatically underline that it is not purely economic in character.
The Commission has therefore proposed clearer definitions of the concepts of 'workers' information' and 'workers' consultation' and a clarification of how these activities correlate at various levels.
It also insists that cooperation within the framework of this strategy should, first and foremost, be based on the needs of the stakeholders concerned and is thus of the opinion that the political priorities addressed have to be decided through a consensus.
If the attacks on the civilian population continue, and that seems to be the case, the EU must negotiate a UN mandate and action to create a nofly zone over Libya to avoid a human catastrophe.
Enhanced cooperation must then be authorised by the Council, following consultation with or assent from Parliament, depending on the situation.
Europe's cultural potential must be used strategically.
We are expecting definite intervention from the EU.
The Conference of Presidents is responsible for the order of business, and we will discuss the matter this Thursday.

Like everything excessive, it is ridiculous.
I have the impression that there is the possibility today of ending Mrs Haidar's hunger strike and finding a solution for her.
Some of my fellow Members here have echoed this and that is why they signed.
Given the introduction of that protection, and the value of the underlying principle of this legislation, I strongly support the compromise.
I should like now to thank everyone here for all the speeches and suggestions you have made and to say that I have taken note of them and of your concerns, particularly those of what I would call a more social nature, that is, the possible consequences that the recent financial turbulence might have for citizens.
Also, from a general point of view, the chapter on investment must respect both parties' right to legislate in areas such as the environment, public health, employee and consumer rights, industrial policy and cultural diversity, among others.
Particular attention must be focused on removing all those difficulties that hamper access to Community funds and discourage people from obtaining EU financial support.
For this reason, body scanners are being introduced in a mad rush as if they were a miracle cure.
See how hypocrisy has been elevated into a governing principle!

We will strive to strictly apply international auditing standards in all areas, including when taking into consideration the work of other auditors, namely those engaged in the Member States in auditing European Union funds.
As my fellow Members in this Chamber have mentioned, we must quickly rid the system of all types of fraud and help the business sector as much as we can to eliminate the barriers that the current system creates.
I would like to congratulate the Presidency on addressing the issue of disabilities at a high level until the end of the trio.
It so happens that I have been a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control at a crucial time, and I thank you for the changes that you have made, because they are a great help to us.
I have therefore supported amendments to exempt airports in the outermost regions from the new regime, and look forward to the production of a framework that takes account of the fragile nature of many communities.
The Council declared that ACP countries and regions, if they so wished, could depart where necessary from the provisions agreed by other countries or regions during EPA negotiations.
In particular we should ensure that the Framework Decision is also applied to national data processing; otherwise the point of the entire proposal is called into question.
Similarly, the Commission cannot accept weakening a woman's right to refuse night work.
(EL) Mr President, obviously, I, too, support the provision of humanitarian aid by the European Union as and where possible.
Over the last nine years, 77 European airline companies have gone bankrupt.
Naturally, I support the Swedish position on the issue - namely that the decision on abortion is ultimately a decision for the woman concerned, not a matter for the legislators.
(NL) Mr President, we have a real emergency in Europe.
I therefore encourage the Commission to continue the ambitious strategy it was able to carry out when it concluded a free trade agreement with South Korea.
The institutions and instruments that govern this Union are appropriate, especially if we take into account the improvements introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon.
- Before the vote on Amendment 7:
I believe that we are at risk of doing more harm than good with this resolution because no attention is being paid to the efforts which Morocco is making to achieve a lasting, just solution to the Western Sahara conflict.
Parliament also addressed the Commission about the delays in the proposed European Charter on Volunteering, which is expected to define better the role of volunteering.
On the one hand, I am personally delighted with the reinforcement of the role of the national parliaments and the national executives through the so-called flexibility clause.
In my view, both the EU and the US need to rethink and probably redefine the transatlantic partnership to adapt to the new situation.
I firmly believe that, on the basis of the tasks, objectives, principles and instruments defined by all the Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and furthermore based on the shared competences as well as the supporting, coordinating and complementary actions of the Union, a very strong strategy on Roma inclusion can come into existence.
I also voted in favour, because I agree that it is unacceptable for an organisation financed by Europe not to have sound and transparent management of its finances after so many years.
Detailed analyses of needs and the associated cost analyses will enable us to keep within the financial framework and at the same time should ensure that Parliament functions smoothly and that the new tasks can be handled.
I would urge you to oppose any proposal which might be used to legalise any whaling for scientific purposes and commercial whaling on the coast and elsewhere or equally to allow international trade in whale products.
However, is the European Union ready to commit 0.3% of its GDP to its policy for halting biodiversity loss and to convince the OECD countries to do the same?
I should also like to mention a few figures.
On 8 February 2005 at Sharm el Sheikh, Sharon declared: 'We have an opportunity to start on a new path.
We see the new generations being bombarded by the fast-food chains - I will not name them all here today - which are spreading throughout the European Union.
As soon as we receive these documents, we will be able to prepare our draft opinions and recommendations for each country, so that they can be adopted before the June European Council, which will mark the end of the very first European semester.
It is a fact that this sort of action reduces the operating costs of companies, increases their profitability, and possibly makes a positive contribution towards maintaining jobs.
What are you doing in the interim?
At least one woman should be appointed to these.
Secondly, when it comes to amendments, these are now prohibited for own-initiative reports.
It is impossible to be a little in favour of the free expression of opinion.
After Parmalat and Enron, we asked the Commission and Council in 2003-2006 to speak out on rating agencies.
The European Commission and the European Parliament should regain their strategic role and go for brave European solutions.
Of course we have to see what is the appropriate level of using the European dimension - the subsidiarity issue that was raised by some of you - but I think that we can agree that even the biggest Member States alone cannot face all those challenges and that we need some level of European commitment.
At a time when Europe is considering a common strategy for its supply of raw materials and especially rare earths, we cannot overlook the huge potential that the intelligent recovery of our waste offers.
They will have to balance Economic and Monetary Union.

We must step up our efforts to persuade the Turkish army to supply information to the competent committee in order to put an end to the suffering of the missing persons' relatives.
We have consulted each other, some groups have proposed a resolution and we have fortunately come to a joint resolution.
Firstly, the fact that you hold the Presidency has more than merely symbolic value.
After all we are not dealing with just any chemicals; the list of chemicals contains the most hazardous chemicals used by man on earth today.
However, with regard to the recycling of rare earth elements, and the question asked by Mr Rinaldi during his speech, I can answer by explaining the recycling measures that we as the European Commission intend to take.
If you really want the floor, I will now have to give it to you but please do not just ask for the floor just to express some kind of disagreement with the process.
We are satisfied with the way in which we dealt with finance together, a common concern within such an important plan.
Many EU countries, including Sweden, have also largely coped with the low birth rate and the demographic problems, partly through a well-developed welfare policy and through immigration.
I think we should support the Commission proposal, and, to those who think that this could be destabilising, I would like to say that stability will come with European integration.
Next, this unilateral recognition is in serious danger of going against the EU's stated objectives in the Balkans.
The relationship is based on deep economic integration: 40% of Turkey's foreign trade goes to the EU and 80% of foreign direct investments in Turkey come from the EU.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I greatly appreciate the work carried out by the two rapporteurs.
He also served as Chairman of the Socialist Group between 1979 and 1984.
As we heard from our Members, and the many points of view expressed, it has been a successful presidency.
This flexible structure will allow us to rise to the challenges at EU level.
The Ministry of Interior, together with certain private companies, are ripping off Bulgarian taxpayers, they are robbing them systematically, and then on a huge scale.
I also wish to congratulate the Portuguese Presidency for arranging and organising this summit - as I feel it was urgently needed - and especially for its great success.
The whole region is in need of democratic development and support from the European Union.
By means of Mr Frattini's phone call and of statements by Mr Maroni, the Italian Government has signified that it does not want to take any legislative measures that contravene European legal standards in any way.
This report sends a very positive message by drawing our attention to how to respond in this area at local level: how to respond specifically to local needs.
The rules are the same as ever: one minute for a question, one minute for an answer and, in the event that any of the political group chairs wish to ask an additional question, another question and answer lasting 30 seconds each.
Once again, as well as what is called for in this particular resolution, I would call on each and every one of us, as responsible individuals, also to take action in communicating our distress on this particular case.
Mr President, Mr Barroso observed that we are living in extraordinary times - true - but extraordinary times call for extraordinary leadership.
As a Parliament we need now to move away from words and provide concrete actions that can support India's needs.
He responded to concerns expressed on the reopening of talks with the Mercosur countries and, while his words brought some comfort to those who listened - because he said he would ensure that the interests of EU farming and the EU farm model would be safeguarded - I am afraid I was not reassured.
These are the biggest deficiencies.
He has our clear support to lead the Commission for another term.
Why not battle groups?
The European Court of Human Rights is not in Luxembourg.
What is a covenant?
For this reason, we should take particular care to ensure that this policy is developed in line with economic, social and cultural interests.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioners, I would like to come back to the anti-counterfeiting agreement which is currently being negotiated, in particular, with the United States.
(PL) Mr President, much has been said and there have been many discussions in recent years about the role of women, their rights, their position in society and their occupational situation.
President-in-Office of the Council. - In the new Member States you have different conditions.
This does not mean we are using history for our own ends, for the history of Europe is like a great river, into which flow manifold tributaries and streams, and the diversity of traditions and cultures which have created Europe is its great wealth.
Both can play their part in getting the most out of our various sources of protein.
Mrs Zdravkova also deserves hearty congratulations on having achieved unanimous decisions and cooperation in her first report for our committee.
Cambodia has accepted all the recommendations of the United Nations Human Rights Council in the Universal Periodic Review.
It is a vehicle for globalist power; it is preparing our economic, moral and cultural subversion.
The problems in the eurozone today are clear proof of the failure of the weak approach that we have followed over the last 10 years with the so-called open coordination method.
It is patently illegal.
(The President cut off the speaker)
The fingerprinting of children less than 14 years of age is done based on a form used in criminal investigations, which infringes the fundamental rights of the citizens.
I now have a request for Mr Daul, and will therefore continue in French.
The provision does not affect the discretion of Member States to determine which infringements are to be characterised as serious.
Thirdly, I am concerned about the food crisis that is taking shape and the effects of climate change.
The transport sector is a typical example.
Through the measures undertaken, the European Union must follow this electoral process, as you have said, but also be more ambitious in the development of relations with Iraq.
The EU should ask for explanations from the Egyptian authorities and make it clear that further violence will be followed by the cessation of European financial and humanitarian assistance.
We must discuss it with the Czechs, the Poles and the Russians.
Telling ourselves 'Let us build upon the work we have done because we just need to make some changes' is not enough.
I welcome the increased appropriations in the area of freedom, security and justice and I would stress that building a Europe of citizens also depends on proper implementation of these budget headings.
This is a crucial question that can cause serious problems, as the relevant legislation is very different in our Member States.
I should also like to stress the ineffectuality of the Spanish Members from the People's Party (PP) and the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE).
(BG) Mr. President, distinguished colleagues, the adoption and implementation of comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation in the European Union Member States is a tangible achievement and it is indicative of how sensitive a society is respecting the principles of equal treatment of all citizens, regardless of their ethnic origin, faith, gender, age, health or financial condition.
Having a Parliament determine the basis of its own composition seems to me to be fundamentally flawed.
However, climate, food and social crises are also making their impact felt just as much.
Parliament needs these powers.
However, this sensitivity is not a valid excuse to turn the European Parliament into a stage to make the most absurd of accusations, namely racism, against a national government which declares - at least this is the context of the documents we are talking about - that it is taking charge not only of public order but also of the defence of children, with reference to some nomadic communities in situations of special emergency.
He ordered that in future, all detainees held by the US must be registered with the ICRC.
in writing. - (HU) I would like to congratulate Mrs Toia on her report on the social economy that points out the key role of social economy enterprises in labour market integration, as these enterprises can greatly contribute to development and toward the realisation of social cohesion through their close connection with local communities.
I would like to thank Mrs Bastos, who was the only Portuguese MEP involved in this process.
(LT) In Europe, there has been a rapid increase in the number of elderly people whose only source of livelihood is their pension.
Impact assessments (IAs) can be of significant help from the standpoint of better law making if the economic, social, environmental and public health consequences of the intended political choices are studied throughout the political cycle, along with their impact on the public's fundamental rights.
There are restrictions on non-violent freedom of speech in almost all European Union countries.
(PL) Madam President, today the European Parliament is marking the 75th anniversary of the mass famine in Ukraine, one of the greatest crimes against humanity of the 20th century.
Whilst the intention to simplify contract law and expand cross-border trade is commendable, I nonetheless have doubts about the relevance of this approach: indeed there is a high risk that national rules, which provide maximum protection for consumers, will be bypassed.
Should we discuss this within the task force?
(Applause from the Verts/ALE Group)
The second issue - which I will not go into because it was covered by my colleague Mr Arif - is the rebalancing of rules that were set during the Uruguay Round, during the creation of the WTO, to reflect differences in terms of development, the situation of the least developed countries, the situation of developing countries.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade. - (EL) Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade, I should like to point out that the changes introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon in the area of the common commercial policy contribute overall to the enhancement of its democratic legitimacy, transparency and efficacy of the Union's external action.
The EU must urgently tackle trafficking in the labour market.
These issues therefore fall exclusively within the remit of national law, with due regard for the relevant international obligations of Greece, including the relevant conventions of the International Labour Organisation.
The debate is closed.
I personally contacted the German Federal Minister for Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection, Ilse Aigner, on 6 January, and we exchanged views on what needs to be done to avoid similar contamination and incidents in the future.
We support the measures required in connection with the regulation and transparency of the financial markets.
I would stress the need to strengthen legal instruments aimed at eliminating pay differences between women and men.
(Applause)
In my opinion, the role of the Union should be to plan the sharing out of migration pressures from the Mediterranean between the Member States, and to manage the integration of immigrants effectively.
When you return to Brussels, do what I intend to do: go and visit the Armenian restaurant.
It will have a positive employment effect and is expected to offer significant new business opportunities for EU airlines as well as benefits to the travelling public.
Member of the Commission. - For any agency, my view is that direct financing through taxpayers' money is the best way because, with its own income, you can never guarantee that public service, exactly, is delivered.
I welcome cooperation between the Member States in this area.
Why are citizens not free to decide whether they want their country's participation in EU decision-making to diminish?
If, however, security measures going above and beyond that are taken, then those Member States have to finance this themselves.
It is a pity that Italy did not draw down any of these funds.
What I can tell you is that the Member States take their own decisions on this matter.
I will relay your highly unanimous and general proposal for convening a special session of the UN Human Rights Council to the High Representative.
So that is a completely new situation.
This should not be a competence of the EU.
(HU) Mr President, security of food supply in the EU will be one of the most serious challenges facing security policy in the coming decades.
(PL) Mr President, Mrs Lichtenberger said that there are some reasonable ministers in the European Union's Member States.
In order to act fairly, we cannot compromise ourselves with double standards.
In conclusion, I would like to thank the European Parliament for its constructive contribution to the debate on the coordinated strategy to improve the fight against fiscal fraud.
In addition, Article 176 points out that the European Regional Development Fund is intended to help to redress the main regional imbalances in the Union through participation in the development and structural adjustment of regions whose development is lagging behind and in the conversion of declining industrial regions.
On a more operational level, it also includes a package of more than 50 separate measures, including four legislative proposals that translate these principles into action.
Services represent up to 40% of the gross domestic product of the Union.
Not at all: the objective is actually to provide protection for countries with average incomes which would otherwise, as you well know, fall into a system of generalised preferences.
However it is important that this report does not cause us to diverge from the main goal: further deployment of renewables and the improvement of energy efficiency.
Allow me to thank the rapporteur especially.
Second, the voting machines of a number of Romanian MEPs - expected to vote against - were curiously not working properly.
Mario Scaramella of the Mitrokhin Commission later came to London to warn Mr Litvinenko of murder threats.
My third point is financial regulation.
You are a very good orator, Mr Sarkozy, but I am not so sure that you are that good a listener.
Therefore, it is essential that we take action to improve cooperation between universities, the academic world and business.
This also means that the VAT-based own resources should be abolished and, most importantly, that there must be no EU tax, regardless of its form, while the EU is not a truly representative democracy.
They include the GPS that we are familiar with when we are driving around our towns, and can include road tax systems or road toll systems.
(CS) Madam President, I very much applaud the work of the rapporteur on regulations for improving the accessibility and quality of information on medicines for European patients.
Thirdly, we must all make an effort to communicate with the citizens.
Could the Commission state whether, from a scientific point of view, it is possible for any EU Member State to declare itself a 'GM-free zone'?
Mr President, I would particularly like to thank everyone who contributed to this success here in Parliament.
The original system for administering changes appears ineffective and unsatisfactory in view of new scientific knowledge and technological progress.
The second issue is that we need the certainty that this time, unlike in the past, the agreements will also be implemented in other territories.
I welcome the initiative from the European Commission to amend some of the financial conditions for the Structural and Cohesion Funds so that more cash can reach Member States more quickly.
So there is a huge problem there as well.
The opinion of the Council confirmed these objectives, and it is now also desirable for the Commission to take steps which will lead to the lasting sustainable development of transport, cooperation, a harmonised system of tolls and the further internalisation of external costs.
Accommodation which may be considered exceptional in one Member State may be considered average by a citizen from another Member State.
In the global world of competition and knowledge, the only way to win is to be number one, and that should be our aim.
immediate solidarity measures to meet the most basic needs of millions of human beings;
In some Member States as much as 90% of household waste ends up at landfill sites.
'He who conceals trouble only makes it worse,' warned the illustrious Hungarian poet Gyula IllyÃ©s.
In the current economic situation we cannot allow any wasteful spending or misuse of European funds.
If a worsening economic climate brings increased pressure to bear on the older workers to leave the labour market prematurely, we shall lapse into old errors.
That is quite clear.
We share their concern regarding the risk of further proliferation of the conflict.
A couple of years ago, we were told that our children would not know what snow was.
Establishing a European border management fund would be a just and significant measure in order to bring about centralised coordination, both in terms of resources and of implementing policies.
I welcome the general thrust of the intent of the banks, particularly in relation to climate control and energy, and I hope the House will support the main thrust of the report which I have brought forward.
Member of the Commission. - Both agriculture and forestry can, of course, play an important role in achieving the EU's climate objectives, and non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture are actually included in the EU's Effort Sharing Mechanism, but emissions and removals of CO2 related to land use, land-use change and forestry (what we call LULUCF) are not part of the current reduction commitment as adopted back in the 2008 in the climate and energy package.
Despite the many problems we are currently encountering, multilateral cooperation in the context of this region is far more advantageous, as it will enable cooperation within the framework of all the states associated together in Mercosur to be maintained and at the same time deepened, regardless of their economic position in the region.
The lip service paid by the European Union to religious freedom is not enough.
Sheep farming is, however, particularly important for countries with difficult geographical conditions.
I would like to share three facts with you on this matter.
I support my fellow socialists from the Committee for Workers International in the region who call for elections to a new parliament but make clear that nothing will change unless workers and the rural masses have their own candidates and independent working class party to reverse the disastrous privatisations of the last 20 years, to tackle neoliberal capitalism and to institute real democratic change and new institutions controlled by working people and with genuine planning of the economy and a Socialist Federation of Central Asia.
Now is not the time for the status quo, or routine.
This promising future is why we must move swiftly on a comprehensive settlement, with action on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks.
Oral explanations of vote
A new Europe is not a Europe where each one decides what they want and how they want it.
The European Arrest Warrant is a gross miscarriage of justice in itself.
In this respect, the Commission is identifying clear criteria to apply before further contributions to the Global Fund can be resumed.
The topic is WikiLeaks and cyber security.
The consensus defines these principles for action, on which our institution's humanitarian action is based.
Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of 20 December 2006, established the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) with the aim of supporting workers who lose their jobs due to structural changes in the context of the global economy.
I voted against the majority resolution because it failed to stipulate the improvement of environmental performance as a precondition for receiving public money.
Its place in Article 1, which concerns the scope and the objectives, makes this proposal in essence a principle that applies to all the directives in the package, particularly where access and services are concerned.
I therefore voted in favour.
To this end, it is important that entrepreneurs in Ireland are fully informed on how to make best use of the Small Business Act.
Amid the general silence, in mid-2003, the manufacturer, thinking that this silence meant that the German authorities' unexplained comments had clearly been refuted, placed the product back on the market.
The basis of the report, as it emerged from the work of the Human Rights Subcommittee, is reasonably good, and it has some elements that I believe are essential.
Member States in South-Eastern Europe are faced with huge deficits.
Member States retain their power to set these admission criteria and the number of migrants they wish to admit to their own country with a view to taking up employment.
(Applause)
rapporteur. - Mr President, my recommendation is to vote against postponement as conditions for postponement have not been met by the Council.
History teaches us that armed conflicts are an outcome of the inability of the combatants to talk about contentious issues and find compromise solutions.
As far as this goes, this is a right and sensible path to take.
This measure will reduce child abuse by organised criminals across borders, which is another reason why I support this apparently controversial topic.
Are there any proposals from the Council with regard to putting together a team of facilitators to allow the different traditions in Bosnia-Herzegovina to come together to agree a common standard or common code for how the police force should work?
In 2007 the Council reached political agreement on a framework decision which aims to ensure that each Member State can respond as fully and correctly as possible to requests for criminal records made to them on their nationals.
A land border can be closed relatively easily, but a sea border cannot.
Liberalisation and international trade deregulation policies are a central tenet of this policy framework, and are contributing decisively to the current situation.
In November 2005, MEPs and Member States adopted the Mining Waste Directive.
However, because of the considerable differences in gas and energy markets I would be in favour of the rapporteur's proposal that these sectors be regulated separately.
The current situation in Yemen and the terrible suffering to which its people are being subjected should be analysed in the light of this situation.
It is what the electorate of Europe now expects, and will enable us to act together with strength.
Just imagine!
Projects relating to the continuing growth of cooperation between Member States in the field of education, exchanges of good practice, as also the Europe of Knowledge and Innovation, are all supported both by the Polish government and the EU authorities.
As stated in the resolution, the Commission and the Member States must make every effort to ensure that a proper portion of the money available for health care reaches poor people in developing countries and every effort must be made to ensure that health care services in poor areas are improved and supported.
Our problem is that we also encounter enormous levels of prejudice in our societies - and I mean now in those Member States where the problems with Roma are perhaps worse than in other Member States.
Apparently, they have fewer cars in these countries, so maybe that percentage is lower.
The single telephone number that Henry Kissinger allegedly demanded is brought up again and again.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, I very much welcome the Commissioner's statement and in particular the tone in which he opened it when he was referring to patients as being the centre of this.
At the same time, however, we seldom stand up for the rights of Christians in those very same countries, in the countries where possessing a Bible is often punished by many years in prison, and on many occasions even death, in countries where it would not just be hard to build a Christian place of worship, it would be simply impossible.
Pending wider solutions, it is essential that we can count on solid arrangements between us when we are deployed together in the same theatre.
Does it know what voodoo rites are?
Particularly adverse phenomena are to be seen in rural areas, where the number of young people wanting to take over the running of farms continues to fall.
That would be a recipe for communal strife in the future.
In today's vote, we saw support for the report concerning innovative financing in the world and in Europe.
Action taken on Parliament's positions and resolutions: see Minutes
This situation must improve.
(PL) I would like to go back to Questions Nos 7 and 8, and to relations between the European Union and Russia.
The clause contains proposals for additional measures.
I also wish to warmly thank the rapporteur, Carlos Coelho, for his remarkable report and also for the excellent cooperation maintained with the Commission on a delicate and sensitive issue.
However, some sort of cooperation between the Commission and Member States would be desirable to ensure good practices and strategies capable of guaranteeing the utmost transparency and to prevent possible illegal and casual adoptions, but also to ensure the maximum level of cooperation from Member States in guaranteeing the right of adoption and preventing children from being abandoned to themselves or, as I said before, abandoned to an institution.
The rather contemptuous satisfaction shown here regarding the 'yes' extracted from the Irish after months of harassment, guilt campaigns, lies and half-truths is a disgrace to democracy and an insult to the will of the people.
I believe there are huge possibilities for dialogue, but not just on human rights and not just on the all-important nuclear issue.
It looks as if the issue of climate change is not what is important here, just business issues.
The directive presses all the right buttons and goes some way towards addressing the problem.
We can only condemn the use of force and violence by the police and the KGB against protesters on election day.
This weekend, I heard a talk from a leading Scottish psychiatrist and also someone from Barnardo's.
Thanks to this report, we are presented with a different image of culture.
I am anxious about the wording of some of the compromises.
In recent years, the Italian Government has tried everything possible to resolve the long-standing issue of the waste collection and disposal system.
I would therefore suggest that an inquiry be carried out and that you and we sit down to determine the research question, that we have an enquiry carried out and that we then discuss this at length.
2007 was the first year - as various fellow Members pointed out - in which the Member States were asked to draft an annual summary of the available inspections and statements, but, according to the Court of Auditors, it does not work.
We agreed to discuss nuclear issues and we accepted that these are a subject to be debated between us, because it was made clear from the beginning that no subject was taboo.
However, this compromise represents a balance between the environmental requirements and the quality-related economic constraints.
These include illegal removal of tags, smuggling of cattle across borders from foot-and-mouth-affected areas, and the proper testing of cattle.
We believe in equality for all people in Europe.
This support force could be located in high-risk countries and be ready for action from the summer of 2008.
